Stewie," Oh, Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know! Ah, Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War."""
Lois," Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies."
Stewie," How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Ooh, fuzzy."
Teletubby, [giddy laughter] Tickle.
Stewie," God, the more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!"
Teletubbies, Again! Again!
Stewie," Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Oh, dear God, please once more!"
Peter," Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham."
Stewie," I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless."
 Weed," Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Let's not forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties."
Pawtucket players, [Raucous laughter]
Peter, [Peter giggles] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses.
Peter," Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. You know, when Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Huh, am I right? Who's with me?"
 Weed, This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon: Guillermo.
Man, [Screaming]
 Weed, Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he will be an asset to our company on and off the field.
Weed," Back to work, people."
Peter," Heya, Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation: cute as a button/fat as a cow/radioactive scorpion. Huh? Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair!"
 Weed, I'll consider it.
Peter," He'll consider it! Hey, I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park."
Contestant," Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. ""Go tuck yourself in."""
Pat Sajak, You got it.
Chris," Well, you were close, Dad."
Peter," Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, ""My hairy aunt."" Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice."
Lois, Practice? I thought we were go next door and welcome our new neighbors.
Peter," Oh, no, no, no. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again."
Man," If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it."
Lois," Peter, they might be very nice people."
Peter," ""Very nice people."" Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and bam! Skeleton city!"
Brian, [Panting]
Woman, Pervert!
Brian," Oh, don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands."
 Weed," Okay, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys, time for batting practice. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately, Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor."
Peter," Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch."
Brian," Ha. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity."
Peter," Oh, how hard..."
Peter," Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?"
Peter, Okay. Take your base.
 Weed," Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired!"
Peter," Oh, man. What am I gonna do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model."
Guy, But I don't want to be different.
Peter," What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? Ah, this is gonna drive me nuts!"
Lois, Moving is never easy on a family.
Bonnie," Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever."
Lois," Oh, Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo."
Man," I-17. Oh, darn it. [screams]"
Bonnie," Oh, I haven't played Bingo in years!"
Stewie," Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! Aagh!"
Bonnie, [Chuckles] What a little explorer.
Lois, Yes. He's so full of wonder.
Stewie," Oh, to be the Lindbergh baby right about now."
Bonnie," Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin."
Joe," It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?"
Lois," This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson."
Stewie, You will bow to me.
Meg, Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.
Kevin, I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.
Meg, Will you go out with me?
Kevin, I'd love to.
Chris," Oh, he's gay."
Meg," You wish! Get out of here, you mouth-breather!"
Peter," I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. Ah, great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors."
Brian, I think she wants you to meet them.
Peter," She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem."
Peter," What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference."
Joe, You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
Peter," Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You know, you got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, you know, don't think you always have to bug me."
Joe," [laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"
Peter," Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Then before you know it, you're using my supermarket, my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Sheesh, can you believe that guy? ""Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"" What an ass."
Brian," So, Peter, did you find a replacement for the team?"
Peter," No. Believe me, I've been looking."
Manager, Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he wishes to know what compensation you offer.
Peter," Uh, me love you long time."
Brian," Gosh, I'd like to help you, Peter. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on the back of my ass for"
Lois," Oh, Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday."
Peter," Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first."
Lois, Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.
Peter, He did?
Peter," Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe."
Joe, Peter!
Peter," Oh, don't get up."
Joe, This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.
Peter," Oh, what? Because of what I said this afternoon. Oh, no, no, no. See I have that disease where stuff just pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?"
Joe," Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver."
Peter, Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want.
Joe," Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?"
Peter, Picture wire? You son of a bitch.
Peter, Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.
Joe, I don't want to impose.
Peter," No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team, like this Saturday. What do you say, neighbor?"
Joe, Sounds fun.
Peter," So much fun it should be illegal like...copyright infringement. [Mickey Mouse voice] See you at the game, Joe."
Pawtucket player," Hey, you want a piece of gum?"
Quahog player," Oh, thanks."
Pawtucket player, Ha-ha! That was joke gum.
Quahog player, What do you mean?
Pawtucket player, Now you're addicted to heroin.
Quahog player, I'm cold.
Lois," Hey, Peter!"
 Weed," It's nice that your family is here, Peter. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them-at home."
Peter," He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. He can hit, he can throw..."
Joe, Peter!
 Weed, What's he doing in a wheelchair?
Peter," Holy crip, he's a crapple!"
 Weed," Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic?"
Peter," Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. Stand and deliver. Get the hell up."
Joe," Ha, ha, you're a hoot, Peter."
Umpire, Play ball!
Joe, Let's do it!
Peter, I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
Joe, I got shortstop.
Bonnie, The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. I tried everything to get the stain out.
Lois, What about lemon juice?
Bonnie, What about club soda?
Stewie, What about shutting the hell up?
Meg, Isn't baseball great? [pause] They say baseball's the national pastime. [longer pause] I can't taste salt.
Peter," Ah, crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! Please don't hit it to Joe!"
Umpire, You're out!
Peter," All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!"
Bonnie, All right!
Lois, Did you see that?
Bonnie, That's my Joe!
Stewie," What the deuce? Half man, half machine. Why, with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg!"
 Weed," It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!"
 Weed," All right, Joe! Run!"
Peter," All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!"
 Weed," Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!"
Player, Let's hear it for Joe!
Peter," Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Yay. Okay. Huh."
Joe," That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket."
Bonnie," Joe, you're so funny."
Joe, They love that one down at the precinct.
Peter," Ah, this sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder."
Joe," Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!"
Brian, Face it. He's the life of the party.
Peter," Ah, yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! Hey! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Huh? Guys?"
Joe, That's my idea.
 Weed," Peter, come here."
Peter," Oh, finally. A little recognition."
 Weed, Joe has the most wonderful idea.
Joe," Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys. You know, to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!"
Peter," Oh, yeah, that's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug."
 Weed," Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink."
Peter," Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat.... No. No. He can't take that away from me."
Stewie, You! How came you by this metal construct? I demand to know who made you!
Lois," Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry."
Joe," That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago, I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen."
Joe," Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas."
The Grinch," You think you have won, you think all is well, but kiss my green ass, I shall see you in hell!"
Joe," Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy."
Stewie," Oh, enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably, I shall take the information from you by force!"
Lois," Well, looks like you have a fan."
Peter, Come on. Let's get out of here.
Joe," Peter, you can't leave."
Peter," Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii, right now. Say aloha, kids."
Meg, What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.
Chris," He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy."
Joe," Well, technically, he was killed by the state, but funny story-he did curse my name just before the injection."
Lois," Peter, what's the matter with you?"
Peter," Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You're not supposed to admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. Jeez, when did it become okay to be handicapped?"
Lois," Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man, and the rest of your family adores him."
Peter," Well, fine, then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. ""Hey, look at me, I'm walking. Ooh, I'm a remarkable man."""
Peter," Well, look who finally came home. Jeez, I thought you were gonna spend all night over at Joe's."
Brian, I could have. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear-forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop.
Peter, I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on.
Brian," Well, it's not too hard to see why. I mean, the guy's a hero; he makes the world a better place."
Peter," Hey, hey, hey, I've done lots of things to help people. Remember that time I sang to the kids down at the Sunday school?"
Brian," Yes, and you forgot the words."
Peter," ? Jesus loves me, he loves me a bunch? ?'Cause he always puts Skippy in my lunch ?"
Brian," No, no, no, it's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger, every day."
Peter," [sighs] You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero...unless I put myself in real danger, too, for my family's sake!"
Brian, Why are the pretty ones always so dumb?
Stewie, [Screaming]
Dispatch radio," We hava a gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead."
Brian," Is it me, or is rap music just getting lazier?"
Peter," No, no. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime."
Dispatch radio, We have a domestic disturbance...
Peter, Boring!
Dispatch radio, Report of a stabbing at...
Peter, Blah blah blah blah blah.
Dispatch radio, All units! All units! A major bank robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous.
Peter, Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
Brian," Uh, over at Joe's."
Peter," Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave!"
Peter, Uh-oh.
Peter," Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
Peter, You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Lois," Peter, what's the big rush?"
Peter," All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal."
Girl," No, don't go."
Peter," I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. 'cause there's a five-year sleepover at the big house, and you're invited."
Peter," Oh, Lois and the kids should be in here to see this."
Brian, Yes. It's going very well.
Meg," Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?"
Chris, Meg loves Kevin.
Meg," Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!"
Lois," Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around."
Meg, Such a mom answer.
Lois," Well, have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer?"
Meg, Creepy.
Lois," Oh, I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys."
Brian," Well, if you want to be a hero, now might be a good time."
Peter," Jeez, Brian, this isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games."
Peter," Sorry, Wonder Woman, I got three kings. Now let's see your pair."
Peter," Haha, all right. Hey, Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her."
Peter," Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan."
Brian," Oh, good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise."
Peter," Oh. Well, actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back."
Peter," Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife. Okay. And where are we?"
Old woman," Guadalajara, Mexico!"
Peter," Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy."
Peter," Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here."
Cop," All right, stand back!"
Peter," Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. See, this wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and, well..."
Girl, Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you?
Peter, That's right! How'd you know?
Old woman, We've all been there.
Chris, Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
Lois," Officer, my husband's in there! Can you tell me if he's okay?"
Lois," He's wearing a white, collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses."
Lois," Oh, thank God."
Lois, No!
Peter," Hey, there's my family."
Peter," But...but, I was gonna be a hero."
Bonnie," Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!"
Tom Tucker, A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. [pause] That's right. A hostage situation.
Joe, I gotta go.
Bonnie, I know.
Peter," Uh, excuse me. Shouldn't that be ""whom""?"
Peter, Crap!
Joe, This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out together.
Peter," Aw, jeez, not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible."
Lois," Bonnie, it's Peter."
Bonnie, Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours.
Meg, I can't believe my dad is in there. [pause] This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. [pause] I got a new dress.
Meg, So do you like music?
Kevin," Oh, yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?"
Meg, You first.
Kevin," I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway, because I am not a robot!!! I also like Radiohead."
Joe," And even though society has turned its back on you, I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them."
Peter," Oh, come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait, wait, wait. You can't leave now. I'm supposed to be the hero here. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Dang, stupid robbers"
Stewie," Aha! Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter."
Lois, There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.
Stewie," Augh! One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be..."
Lois," Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove?"
Peter, I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero.
Lois," Peter, Joe is a hero, but he's not our hero. You are."
Peter, Really?
Lois," Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it."
Meg," Yeah, Daddy. And if you hadn't pulled this stunt I never would have learned how to manipulate Kevin."
Chris," And when the kids at school see us on TV, they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, ""That psycho is my dad!"""
Michelle Kwan," And I would never have won the silver in Nagano, if you hadn't driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m."
Peter, I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love.
Old Woman, Help! Someone just stole my purse!
Peter, Who cares? I don't even know you.
Morley Safer, I'm Morley Safer. 
Mike Wallace, I'm Mike Wallace. 
Ed Bradley, I'm Ed Bradley. 
Lesley Stahl, I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf. 
Lois, [Laughing] I feel so naughty. 
Peter," Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk. "
Lois, [Giggling]
 Peter, Knock it off! 
Lois," Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump! "
Peter, [screaming] 
Lois," The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey. Peter: That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans. "
Lois," Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and... Peter: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just like we do with the squid. "
Lois, Earthquake. 
Peter, Truck going by. [front walk] 
Peter, I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. Nothing to worry about. [black cat hisses] [black vulture screeches] 
Black man, Morning. 
Peter, Ah! [at health care center] 
Peter," Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have? "
 Hartman," Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But hey, what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had. Look at the size of this file. This is...wow. Let's just wait for the test results. "
Lois," Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap. "
Stewie," No. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast! "
Lois, I'm so worried about your father. Chris: You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic? 
Lois, No. Mommy's made peace with that. 
Chris, Oh. 'Cause he's got a lump on his boobie. 
Lois," Chris, that's a terrible word, ""boobie."" "
Meg," Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay. "
Lois, Really? Who's Debbie Miller? 
Meg, A girl I just made up. 
Peter," Oh, look. There they are-my family. You know, guys, I don't say this often enough, but, uh, I'm gonna die. "
Lois," Oh, my God. "
Stewie, High five! Anyone? Anyone? 
Chris, You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance? 
Peter," Listen, I've had a good life. And you can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments. "
Meg, What accomplishments? 
Peter, Go to your room. 
Lois," Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important character in this family. [Somber music playing] "
Peter, I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60.
 Salesman," Sir, that casket costs $1,000. "
Peter," Okay, $70. "
Salesman, What? 
Peter," $2,000. "
Salesman, That's twice what it costs! 
Peter, $40. 
Salesman, What? 
Brian, He doesn't know how to haggle. 
Lois," Peter, what's going on? "
Peter," I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had so much fun playing with that. [child Peter] "
Peter," More tea, Mr. Bike? "
Lois," Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine. "
Meg," Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in. "
 Hartman," This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me. Look at the nose. It's all, all... "
Lois, Will you just tell us about Peter's tests? 
 Hartman," Okay, okay!. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle. "
Peter, Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom? 
 Hartman," Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine. "
Peter," I'm fine? What, are you coming on to me now? "
Lois," Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy. "
 Hartman, Can't it be both? 
Lois, [Kissing] My sweetie is okay. 
Peter," Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids. Is this the price of my bill or my phone number? "
Clerk, Your phone number. 
Peter," Oh. [Sheepish laughter] Well, it's still pretty pricey! "
Lois," Peter, who cares how much the bill is? You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health. "
Peter," Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem? Aw, this sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? There's nothing wrong with me. "
Brian," Yeah, it's a shame you're not dying. "
Peter," Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill. All I gotta do is write ""deceased"" right here where it says ""name."" And where it says ""sex,"" I'll write, ""No, thanks. I'm dead."" It's bulletproof. [Crickets chirping] "
Stewie, But you promised the fat one would perish. 
Lois," I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long... [Knocking] "
Peter, Who are you? 
Death, I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death. Which one of you is Peter Griffin? 
Peter," Uh, he is. "
Death," Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffn? "
Peter, This is Peter Griffin. 
Death," [Laughing] Hey, that's a good one. [Continues laughing] "
Lois, Why are you... 
Death," No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing] Lois: Why are... "
Death, [Continues laughing] 
Lois, Why... Death: [Continues laughing] 
Lois, Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay.
 Death," Oh, the doctor! Well, I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death! "
Stewie, Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan. 
Peter," Look, Death, you made a mistake. I'm not really supposed to be dead. "
Death," I made a mistake, huh? Then what do you call this? "
Lois," Peter, is that your handwriting?"
 Peter, [Nervous laughter] How did you get that? 
Death, It was emailed to me by your HMO. 
Peter," Look, I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names. "
Lois, I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband! 
Stewie," Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest! Won't you join us for dinner, Death?"
 Death," Oh, no. I don't want to impose. Hey, is that turkey? "
Lois," Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner-to celebrate Peter's good health. "
Death," Oh, do you mind? "
Stewie," Mind? Of course she wouldn't mind. It would be an honor. No, no, no, no, it would be a privilege. I-oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde. "
Meg, Ew. How did you do that? 
Death," Oh. Well, let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not...particularly proud of. Well, that does it for me. Let's go, Peter. Lois: Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years. "
Death, 40 or ...[Laughing] Let's go. 
Peter," I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now. Be strong. "
Meg," Oh, Daddy. "
Peter," Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man. Stewie: Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like. [flash to middle-aged Stewie] "
Stewie, A 20-minute call to Larchmont!? Who do we know in Larchmont? 
s Wife, My sister-in-law. 
Stewie," Oh, yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol? Peter: Brian. "
Brian," Oh, God. "
Chris," Daddy, can I come with you? "
Peter, Ask your mother. 
Lois," No, you can't go with him! Oh, Peter. "
Peter, Lois. 
All, [Crying] 
Death," Okay, okay, that's good. Come on now. "
Peter," Hey, Death, you got a file on me? "
Death," Yeah, somewhere, it's in the car, I think. "
Peter," Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track? Death: Oh, let's not do this. Hey, look, I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you? [Screaming] My ankle! Yeah, listen, don't help or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish. [back in house] "
Death," Yeah. That felt good, dropping me hard on the couch like that. Lois: Here's a couple of Tylenol. "
Death," Oh, great, Tylenol. Yeah, I asked for Advil. But, you know, Tylenol, whatever. That's good."
 Meg, I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do? 
Death," Yeah! Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle. I just have to stay off it for a few days. "
Peter, W-w-wait. You can't stay here. 
Death, Why not? 
Peter," You're trying to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper?"
 Lois," Oh, it's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better. "
Peter," Lois, what the hell are you doing? "
Lois," Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die. "
Peter, Go on. 
Lois, That's it. 
Peter," Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Hey, uh, make yourself at home, Death. I'm going out for a while. "
Death," Hey, way, wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers I'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire. Peter: Go on. "
Death, That's it. What the hell do you see in him? 
Lois," Peter, where are you going? "
Peter," Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. But now that I've been given another chance I'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing. [Peter on top of building]"
 Peter, I'm gonna jump off this building.
 Cleveland," Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear. "
Quagmire," Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this? "
Peter," $1,000 says I live."
 Quagmire," 1,000 clams, huh?"
 Cleveland, What the hell?
 Quagmire, Okay. 
Peter, Look at that. I beat my loogie. 
 Cleveland, [Grumbling] 
Lois," It's your turn, Death. "
Death," You know, I know I should find this ironic, but really, I'm just bored as hell. Hey, how old is this TV? You can probably getthe DuMont Network on this thing. "
Lois," You know, Peter is a good man and a wonderful father. "
Death, Here it comes. 
Lois," Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all, it isn't really his time. "
Death," What did you make this cocoa out of, crap?"
 Lois," If you want me to make it again, I... "
Death," Sorry, Lois, it's my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap! "
Lois, I'll be right back. 
Meg, I brought you something to read.
 Death," Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder. [Suspenseful instrumental music] "
Lois, [Screaming] [Saw buzzing] 
Stewie, Victory is mine! 
Lois, Wow. I should really watch where I'm going. 
Stewie," What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. ""Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone"" "
Cleveland," I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch?"
 Peter," Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire! Hey, you guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: ""Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons?"" "
Quagmire," Peter, no! "
Cleveland," Peter, now you're just being brainless. "
Peter," Hey, aren't you Richard Simmons? "
Peter," Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons? "
Peter, [Laughing] [gunfire] 
Cleveland, Hey. [Everyone laughing] 
Death," Ah, that feels good. You know, actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. You know, I really wanted to be a wood nymph. But, man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: ""I have no son. I have no son,"" and Mom...Mom just stood there. "
Stewie," Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's why we've got to get you well."
 Death, What was that? 
Stewie, Nothing! 
Lois," Stewie, leave Death alone. "
Death," He's okay. You know, he reminds me a lot of me at that age. I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward. [car rocking on beach] "
Girl," Oh. Oh, yes. Death: Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Oh, not again. I'm gonna be a virgin forever. Or am I? "
Lois," Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me... "
Death," Okay, okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup. Not bad, though. "
Lois," Peter, Death just agreed to let you live. "
Peter," Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV. Tom Tucker: Our top story tonight, the rules of Death no longer apply. Diane Simmons: That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself! "
Tricia Takanawa," I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed? "
Peter, Why don't you give it a shot? 
Tricia Takanawa," Okay, here goes."
 Peter, [Screaming]
 Tricia Takanawa, What have I done? 
Peter, [Laughing] 
Tricia Takanawa," Oh, you're awful. "
Diane Simmons," Fascinating story, Tom. "
Tom Tucker," It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of Death no longer apply, I can do this. "
Diane Simmons," That's right, Tom. "
Tom Tucker, Ha-ha! And now it's time for sports. 
Death," Great. The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts! "
Lois," Oh, no. You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle. "
Death, This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death! [Dramatic instrumental music] 
Peter," Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination, does it?h "
Lois," Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill anyone. "
Peter," Yeah! I mean, you know, I've thought about it, like in church and stuff, but I don't think I could ever do what you do."
 Death," Why, you think you're better than me? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done. "
Brian," He's right, Peter. You've disturbed the natural order of things. People need to be able to die. [Sentimental instrumental music a la ""Titanic""] "
Kate Winslet, No! 
Leonardo DiCaprio," You know, actually, I think I'm gonna be okay. Kate Winslet: Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you promised. Leonardo DiCaprio: Yeah, about that. Uh, I was pretty sure I was gonna die...'cause actually, there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious. But, you know,thanks for letting me draw you naked. I still can't believe you let me do that! "
Peter," So what, you're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone? "
Stewie, I know! Why don't you kill Lois? 
Death," No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge. "
Chris, How about if you blow up the Earth? 
Death, Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that. 
Meg, You could kill all the girls who are prettier than me. 
Death," Well, that would just leave England. Wait. Wait, I have it. I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek! "
Peter," I knew it! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: ""I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids."" "
Lois, It's true. He did say it. 
Death," A bunch of hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But...but their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island. If you go right now, you can catch the flight. "
Peter," Forget it, Death. I'm not going to do your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final. See? I'm still here. And there's nothing you can say that'll change my mind. Death: Either you kill them, or I kill you. [Peter on plane] "
Peter," Aw, crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom. "
Man," Look, James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features. "
James Van Der Beek," Sir, I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice. "
Man, Oh. Will you sign my ass? 
James Van Der Beek, You have a pen? 
Peter," Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from? A plane! "
Death," That's great. Listen, those kids on board? "
Peter," Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it."
 Death," Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive. "
Announcer," Today on ""Hitler!"", we'll be talking with Hollywood hunk, Christian Slater."
 Hitler," Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt. [Girls cheering] "
Christian Slater," Yes, yes, you do. "
Hitler, Can we see it right now? 
Christian Slater," Well, all right, Hitler. "
Hitler, Oh! He's going to do it! 
Announcer," If you're going to be in the Los Angeles area, und would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen! Death: Look, Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies. "
Peter," Jeez, everybody? "
Death," Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda? "
Peter, Still me. 
Death, Brenda? 
Peter," ""Yes?"" Just kidding, it's still me. "
Pilot," We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International. If you look out the window to you're right, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn. We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes. "
Peter," Aw, jeez. "
Girl Scouts," ? We like being alive, we like being alive? ?We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive ? "
Peter," I guess it's their time. [the theme from Dawson's Creek (""I Don't Want To Wait"" by Paula Cole) playing] "
Pacey," Boy, for a teacher, you sure make love good. "
Teacher," Actually, it's ""well,"" Pacey. You mean to say, I make love ""well."" You're good to go again, right? "
Pacey," Yeah, yeah, yeah! "
Death," Peter? Hello, Peter? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing! "
Peter," Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays...other than the fine programs on Fox. Hey, open up in there! "
Pilot," Hey, what are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world! Peter: I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens! "
James Van Der Beek," Nice going, fat... "
Peter," Hey, I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die. No one can land this plane. "
Karen Black, I can. 
Peter," Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in ""Airport '75""? It was a movie, in the '70s. Ah, you damn kids with your music. Tom Tucker: Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black, star of such films as ""Nashville"" and ""Five Easy Pieces,"" was on board. "
Diane Simmons," Our hats are off to Miss Black for proving once again, that, given the opportunity, actresses over 50 can land large aircraft. Tom Tucker: Karen Black. What an obscure reference. "
Death," Hey, what the hell? I told you to waste those kids from ""Dawson's Creek."" "
Lois," You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply. And now the whole world does. Death: Yeah, I guess so. You know, my ankle's starting to feel better. I should probably get out of your hair. "
Stewie," Oh, but you just got here! Oh, we can stay in touch, can't we? Oh, oh, oh, what's your e-mail? Mine is ""LoisMustDie,"" all one word, @yahoo.com."" "
Peter," Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met. Because you've given me a great gift-the complete Boz Scaggs. How did you know? "
Death, I just had a feeling. 
Lois," We're gonna miss you, Death. "
Death," Hey, don't worry. I'll be back...really, really soon. [Laughing] ""Is he joking?"" Okay, see you later. [closing theme music"
Tom Tucker," It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save the life of a fish, trapped under the frozen ice. Rescue workers managed to get the fish out of the water, but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane? Diane Simmons: Well, Tom, another life was tragically cut short today. Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players, passed away this afternoon. "
Lois," Oh, my God! [Phone ringing] "
Diane Simmons," Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows, most recently, Miss Saigon. "
Robert Kimble," ?La la la la la, Miss Saigon ? ? La la la la la, Miss Saigon? "
Lois," Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players! "
Chris," All right, Mom! "
Meg, Are you gonna do it? 
Lois," I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to think. [pause] Okay, I'll do it. "
Tom Tucker, This just in: Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players. 
Lois, All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off. 
Brian," Oh, Lois, congratulations! Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one. "
Lois," Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else. "
Brian," Oh, God, of course. I...you didn't think...you thought I was...Lois! "
Chris, I can paint scenery. 
Meg," Can I be in the show, Mom? "
Stewie," Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive. [vicious laughing] "
Peter," Hey, you guys. "
Lois," Peter, guess what? I am gonna... "
Peter, Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus. 
Chris," Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome toy. Meg: It's already been invented. "
Chris, Then how come I never heard of it? 
Peter," This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company! Sorry, Lois. What's your news?"
 Lois," Well, I- "
Peter," Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board, may I present this year's hottest toy...Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens. "
 Weed," Thank you, Peter, that's enough. "
Peter," Wait, wait, wait. This is the best part! He dances! "
 Weed," Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think. [Laughing]"
 Peter, [Nervous laughter] 
 Weed, I'll take this. No calls. 
Lois," Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions. "
Peter," You should've heard them laughing at me, Lois. I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine. "
Lois," Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert Einstein worked for the patent office. "
Albert Einstein," And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith? "
Smith," I call it ""Smith's Theory of Relativity."" "
Albert Einstein," Hey, look at this. "
Smith," What? Brian: I think what Lois is tying to say is you have to find a way to express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing-beautifully. "
Lois, So I've heard. 
Brian, And Lois has her theater group. 
Lois," Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I. It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal...Peter, please don't wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put your mind to it. Peter: You're right, Lois. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks. "
God," It works! Look how tiny they are! Oof! [Sweeping instrumental music] Brian: ?Oh, no not in springtime ? ? summer, winter, or fall ? ? No, never would I leave you ? ?at all ? "
Joe, Bravo! 
Lois," Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you! "
Brian," No, no, no, thank you. And that note you gave me, ""louder,"" I was thinking that, and then you said it- "
Lois, -okay- 
Brian, -you're so intuitive. It's a pleasure... 
Lois," Okay. All right. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? "
Stewie," ""Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York. And all..."" "
Lois," Why don't you sing ""Itsy Bitsy Spider""? "
Stewie, How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries! 
Lois," Oh, sing ""Baa Baa Black Sheep""! "
Stewie," You know, Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: ""I'm going to kill "
Peter," Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent? "
Lois," Peter, what are you doing here? "
Peter," Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First I took an art class. [Peter in art class, with male nude model] "
Peter, Am I supposed to draw the penis? [back with Lois] 
Peter," Then I tried sculpting. [Peter in sculpture class, with male nude model]"
 Peter, Am I supposed to sculpt the penis? [back with Lois] 
Peter, Then I tried music. [Peter conducting musicians]
 Peter, Am I supposed to conduct with my penis? [back with Lois]
 Peter," I was starting to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage."
 Lois," Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance. Peter: [Laughs] I get it. [Peter gets on stage] "
Peter," Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director. [Laughs] Five, six, seven, eight. "
Peter," [out of tune] ?Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition ? ? Met the greatest earthquake ever known ? ? High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft ? [Yells] ? And plunged them down a thousand feet below ? ? to the Land of the Lost? [Growls] "
Lois," Before I post the cast list, my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning. "
Joe, You were all great. 
Lois," Weren't they? I only wish the show was called ""The King and Us"" so I could cast you all. "
Brian, [kiss-up laughing] 
Loretta," Anna! Oh, baby, baby! I'm a star!"
 Cleveland," Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once, but then we later found out it wasn't actually her."
 Stewie, Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!
 Lois," Oh, you wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie? "
Stewie," Oh, to hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films! [Title card: ""There's Something About Stewie""] "
Ben Stiller, Hello. 
Stewie, What is that on your ear? Is that-is that hair gel? 
Ben Stiller, Yeah. 
Stewie," Great, 'cause I could use some."
 Ben Stiller," No, don't! Stewie: I just ran out. "
Ben Stiller, [Sighing] 
Quagmire," Aw, man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp! "
Brian," The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected! Quagmire: Hey, shut up!"
 Brian," The King of Siam? Why, why, that's the lead! "
Peter," Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not ""The King."" I'm not ""I,"" I'm not anybody. So, what? I had sex with you for nothing? Lois: No, Peter, I.... It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it."
 Peter, Ruin it? 
Lois, Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much talent for the stage. You should...[stuttering]...you should be a producer. 
Peter," A producer? Gee, I don't know. [Peter in robe poolside]"
 Peter," Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr. We made the deal. We're richer and more powerful than ever! I'm the king of the wor-[screams]-damn it! [Mexican dinner music playing] "
Mexican man, [Spanish] Who is this? 
Mexican woman, [Spanish] He's the answer to my prayers! 
Mexican man, [Spanish] Why? [back at theater] 
Peter," I love Mexicans. I'll do it! [Piano playing ""King and I"" music] Joe: Hang on, hang on, hang on! You overextended the plié! You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it! And one, two, three. And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three."
 Lois," Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole. Peter: Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin. "
Lois, There is no talking penguin in The King and I. 
Peter," There is in ""Peter Griffin presents The King and I."" "
Lois, What? 
Peter," Now we just gotta think of some wicked funny stuff for him to say. Lois: Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character. You're the producer, remember? "
Peter," What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois."
 Lois, Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house. 
Peter, And that's creative? 
Lois," Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is. "
Peter," Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there. "
Tom Tucker," [to self in mirror] Hey, I recognize you from the television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this."
 Peter, Excuse me? 
Tom Tucker," You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of here! Peter: Oh, wow! Diane Simmons! "
Diane Simmons," You don't look anything like the ad. You better be huge. Peter: No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting ""Peter Griffin presents ""The King and I"" a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story. "
Diane Simmons," Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn? "
Peter," Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons! "
Peter," Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story on the 11:00 news. "
Brian, Really? 
Lois," Oh, Peter! "
Diane Simmons, Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. Tom? 
Tom Tucker," Thanks, Diane. In other news, I won't be going to the play because I'm sure it will be lousy. "
Diane Simmons," Tom, I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case. "
Tom Tucker, Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane? 
Lois," But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job. "
Peter," Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. Look, Lois, you wanted me to sell tickets, right? Well, people who've never even been in a theater will come see a show with Diane Simmons."
 Lois," I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter. "
Peter," Hey, hey, some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn. "
Sean Penn," Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's gonna be a...get that [bleep]ing camera out of my face! "
Peter," Hey, everybody, here's our star! "
Diane Simmons," Oh, this is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you. "
Loretta," You ever acted before, honey? "
Diane Simmons," Well, I did an independent film in college. [Melancholic instrumental music] "
Lois, Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king. 
Diane Simmons," Oh, are you playing Lady Thiang? "
Loretta, Mmm-hmm. I was supposed to be Anna. 
Diane Simmons," Oh. Well, they did an all-you-people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful. "
Lois," Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action! "
Loretta," ""Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him."" "
Diane Simmons," ""Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him."" "
Peter, Cut! All wrong! No good! 
Lois," Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful. "
Loretta, My ass. 
Lois," Besides, I'm the director. "
Peter," It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had ""I won't share my husband"" and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts. Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane? "
Loretta, I think I can do that. 
Lois," Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not trash TV! "
Diane Simmons, I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of our station's highest-rated shows. 
Lois, I don't know. 
Peter," I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent? "
Lois, I guess we can try that... 
Loretta, Action! 
Peter," Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippy, you know? I was thinking we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants. "
Lois," Peter, they didn't have capri pants in the 1860s. "
Peter, They did now! Ah! 
Stewie," You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! Well, I just plain don't like you."
 ALL, [Laughing] 
Lois, What's going on? 
Peter, We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes. Lois: What changes? 
Peter, The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children. They're aliens! 
Quagmire," That was great, Peter. "
Brian, Right on the money. 
Diane Simmons, Isn't he brilliant? 
Lois, No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant! And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes! 
Meg, We sold out! 
Chris," Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad! "
ALL, [Cheering] 
Lois," Your show? Peter, this is my show! "
Peter," What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did. "
Lois, I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You want to be the director? Fine! I quit! 
Peter," Me, direct? I don't know what to say, except, ""I'm the king of the wor-"" Ah! [kitchen] "
Peter," Morning, theater fans! "
Lois," Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast. "
Peter, What the hell is this? 
Lois, French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I think it's a lot better now. 
Peter," Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno. Stewie: Oh, oh! You know, it is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming. "
Peter," Face it, Lois, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours. "
Lois, I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art. 
Peter," Oh, art-schmart. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare. "
Lois," Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life!"
 Peter," That's not true. I wrote ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" "
Lois," No, you didn't. "
Peter," You win this round, Lois. "
Lois," You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show. Peter: Hey, I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m. "
Lois, The only thing you create before 9:00 a.m. is exactly what you've turned my show into. 
Peter," I think my work will speak for itself. Oh, ha-ha, I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois. [on stage]"
 Peter," Okay, let's run this scene again. Now, remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life."
 Diane Simmons, Where does it say that? 
Peter," In my noodle. Okay, places. And action! [quasi-Flashdance music playing] "
Peter," Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers. "
Diane Simmons, We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted! 
Peter," Well, I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready! "
Diane Simmons, Of course we're not! You keep changing everything!
 Peter," You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her! "
Diane Simmons, I can't work this way. I quit! 
Peter, Fine. 
Joe, We can't do The King and I without Anna. 
Quagmire, Yeah. This is a real snafu. 
Peter," We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along. Someone radiant and sassy, with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression. "
Loretta," Thank you, Peter. I'll do it. "
Peter, Get over yourself. I was talking about me. 
Brian, Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.
 Stagehand," Two minutes, everybody. Two minutes. "
Brian, Fe-fe-fo-fo. 
Peter," Jeez, full house. Well, well, look who came crawling back."
 Joe," Peter, have you seen my wheelchair? "
Chris," I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night?"
 Lois," I came because I love the theater. I mean, if I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be? Chris: A bitch. "
Peter," [voiceover] Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized power. Only one man can stop him. No-one machine. "
Peter, I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android. You may call me ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny. 
Brian," I have been expecting you, ANNA. Allow me to introduce my Siamese children. [Sultry instrumental music]"
 Peter, I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all-female sex orgy. We must kung fu fight!
 Brian," So be it, ANNA. [Kung fu fighting noises] "
Peter, I have slain the evil emperor. I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America. 
ALL, ?ANNA rules!? 
Peter, ?'Cause I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels!? 
ALL, ?ANNA won!? 
Peter, ?Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun!? 
ALL," ?Dance and shout ? ? He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt? "
Peter, ?Though they tried to defeat me ? ? they can all just freakin' eat me? 
Brian, ?Because he blew all of us away? 
ALL," ?In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am? "
Peter, ?Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay? [Heroic instrumental music] [Crowd cheering] 
Lois," Oh, my God! They liked it? Stop it! Stop clapping right now! What's wrong with you? These people shouldn't be encouraged! They should be punished! That man has committed murder here this evening, and the victim's name is ""theater."" This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This...blows! [Gasps]"
 Peter, Uh...[Farting] [Continues farting] [Laughing] [Cheering]
 Lois, See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about. [Griffin bedroom] 
Lois, How was the cast party? 
Peter," We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life. It's the greatest feeling in the world. "
Lois," Yeah, I bet it is. "
Peter, And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me.
 Lois," Well, actually I didn't, really, not at first. But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is...well, he's gotta be creative. "
Peter," Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you. But I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be ""Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production."" Okay, honey? "
Lois, Deal. 
Peter," [chuckling] Hey, were you there when I farted? [closing theme music]"
Lois," Okay. I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates. Then the butterfly house. Then a bathroom break. Then we'll... "
Peter," Come on, Lois. Can't we all run around in a disorganized fashion? Meg: Yeah! "
Stewie," Let it go, Lois! "
Chris, Monkeys throw their poop!
 Lois," No. If we don't adhere to a strict schedule, we won't see everything. "
Peter," Kids, gas masks. Run! [Cheery instrumental music] "
Stewie," There you are. Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr. Pig. Now, where's Mr. Sheep? Is he being baaa-shful? [Laughing] That's right. You're all ripe for parody. "
Brian, Can we go now? 
Stewie," Shut up! I'm having fun. Oh, my! Someone's awfully rude. My fanny is not on the menu! What? Oh! Oh, God! "
Peter," Here, little fella. Come get the food. I have always wanted to do this. "
Lois," Oh, here are the marsupials. Peter, what the hell are you doing? Peter: Look at me, Lois. I'm Roo! Come on, Ma. Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud. "
Stewie, I am going to kick your ass. Theme Song [Sentimental instrumental music] 
Brian, How's it going? 
Man, Great. Beautiful day. 
Brian," Oh, gorgeous. You know, we sit here and force small talk while they have the time of their lives. Man Yeah. Yeah. "
Brian," [Whistles] Here, girl. [Shuddering] Sorry. I thought I smelled...cookies. "
Mort Goldman," Wow! Does it really smell like...oh, God! She farted, and it went down my throat! "
Peter, Full house. 
Cleveland," Dagnab! That's some poker face you've got, Peter. "
Peter," Years of practice, boys. "
Joe," Peter, you're on a roll. We ought to get you down to Atlantic City this weekend. "
Peter," Sorry, guys. Lois is making me visit the in-laws this weekend. I don't know why she even bothers. Me and Lois's old man have never gotten along. [Peter at computer] "
Peter," Hey, I got an e-mail from Mr. Pewterschmidt! "
Joe," You should find some common ground with your father-in-law, Peter. Figure out what he likes, and study up on it. "
Peter," Hey, that's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now. Cratchit, you're working through Christmas! Bob Cratchit: But, sir, what of Tiny Tim? "
Peter," Bah! He and his ukulele shall go wanting. [Peter at newsstand] Peter: Huh-The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. ""I'd be more apathetic if I weren't so lethargic."" [Crickets chirping] [crickets chirping] Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah. Can I have a copy of Jugs? [Peter at adult education class] "
Teacher," In French, when you want to say ""yes,"" you say ""oui, oui."" "
Peter," You gotta be kidding me! Oh, my God! That is hysterical! Oh, man! And what do you say for no? ""Doo-doo""? Hey, I'll be right back. I gotta go take a wicked ""yes."" [Regal instrumental music] "
Crowd, [Exclaiming with comprehension] 
Guy, It's a person. 
Lois," Peter, would you please fix the bathroom faucet? "
Peter, I fixed it already. 
Lois," No, you didn't. It's still dripping."
 Peter," No way! I will give you all my Star Wars cards if it is. Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man. "
Lois," Oh, my God! [Gasping] Was he just mastur... "
Peter, Yes. 
Lois," Oh, my! "
Peter, Do we-do we rub his nose in it? 
Lois," Oh, hi, Brian. "
Brian," Uh, listen, Lois, about yesterday... "
Lois," Oh, Brian. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's perfectly normal. "
Brian," I know. It's just, you know, I should be able to control my baser instincts. But lately I've just been having these urges. "
Lois," Brian, why don't you come up to my parents' house with us? The fresh air will help you relax. "
Stewie, I know where I go when I want to relax. [Stewie at gay dance club] I know the guy that owns this place! 
Man, What? 
Stewie," I said, I know the guy that...I'll tell you later. I love this song. [Dance music playing]"
 Brian, Thanks. But I think a quiet weekend here by myself is just the thing I need. 
Lois," well, have a good time. "
Brian," All right, I'm just gonna relax, mellow out, and watch some television. Announcer: We now return to ""World's Sluttiest Dogs"" on Fox. Brian: Hey, wait up! Peter: [laughs] Right into the bumper. [Cheery instrumental music] Lois: Hi, Mom. Barbara: Oh, look at you all. I know someone who's getting a gift certificate for liposuction in her stocking. Meg: Thank you, Nana. Carter: Hello, everyone. Lois: Hi, Daddy. Peter: Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt. Carter: Did Peter have a stroke? Lois: No, Daddy. Peter's cultured himself, like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Carter: Oh, so I should treat him like a high-class whore. Peter: That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips. Barbara: Would you like a piece of candy? Stewie: I smell death on you! Peter: Ahoy, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Permission to come aboard? Carter: No! Peter: Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here. What is she, like, a 45-footer? Carter: Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor. Peter: I didn't know you looked so good in shorts. [Whistling and purring] Carter: What? Peter: You don't have an eye spliced in this mooring line. I'll tie a bowline in there and make one for you. That should hold her. Sommelier: And this is a '74 Pinot Noir. Man 1: Lovely. Man 2: Carter, did you tell your son-in-law he's not supposed to swallow the wine? Peter: [Slurring] Where the hell is that Peter Griffin? He said he'd give me $100 if I took off all my clothes off. Carter: [Growling] Brian: Thanks for bringing me here, Lois. This is just what I needed. Lois: I'm glad. It seems like everybody's having a lot of fun. Masseuse: So, how long are you and your family in town? Stewie: No conversation. Carter: You idiot! I'm never taking you to my country club again! Peter: Look, I'm sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Carter: Your husband is a moron! He walks up to the premier of China and says, ""Dong, where is my automobile?"" Peter: Lois, I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd, but it's worse than before. I tell ya, this sucks worse than that time I was on Survivor. [on ""Survivor""] Peter: How dare you wash your clothes in our drinking water, Bebe? Now how are we gonna survive in this harsh, unforgiving terrain? Bob Barker: All right, Donny, make sure the wheel goes all the way around. Peter: [Fakes being afraid] Oh, no. Headhunters. Am I fired? Lois: Daddy, Peter's been trying really hard to get you to like him. Couldn't you give him another chance? Let him join your poker game tomorrow night? Carter: Sorry, honey. I'd rather be stuck in an elevator with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried, Carrot Top, uh, Sean Hayes.... well, you get the picture. Lois: Please? Carter: No! Lois: Okay. You know, maybe later I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place and introduce her to that nice mulatto boy who looks an awful lot like... Carter: Say, would Peter like to play poker with us? Lois: He'd love to, Daddy. Carter: That sounds dynamite. [Cheery instrumental music] Carter: Brian, come over here and meet Seabreeze, my prize-winning dog. Isn't she a perfect specimen? I mean, look at these legs, and that beautiful coat, and feel the heat coming off of her genitalia. You could roast a marshmallow. That's how you can tell she's a champion. Go on, put your hand there. Brian: Oh, boy. That is something. Carter: Is that something? Brian: That is something. That is hot. Carter: Isn't she the most beautiful dog you've ever seen? Brian: Yes, yes, she is a beautiful dog. And that's okay. Carter: Gentlemen, this is Peter. He's the idiot my daughter married. Michael Eisner: Michael Eisner. Bill Gates: Bill Gates. Carter: Bill, Peter's an antitrust lawyer with the Justice Department. Just kidding. He's a fisherman, or some stupid thing. Ted Turner: Hey, fellas. Peter: Wow! Ted Turner! Carter: I told you guys not to invite him. Michael Eisner: He must have followed us. Ted Turner: Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards or what? Carter: Peter, why don't you deal? Peter: Okay, guys. We're playing Texas Hold 'Em. Ted Turner: Are aces high or low? Peter: They go both ways. Bill Gates: He said, ""They go both ways."" [All laughing] Ted Turner: Like a bisexual. Michael Eisner: Thank you, Ted. That was the joke. Ted Turner: I see your bet, Carter. And I raise you CNN. Carter: I don't think I can... Peter: Wait, wait, wait. You can beat him, Mr. Pewterschmidt. He's bluffing. Carter: Peter, he just bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing. Peter: I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. Listen, if you lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter. Carter: I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What do you got? Ted Turner: Two pair. Carter: Ace-high straight. Ted Turner: You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's $1 million a year sound? You disgust me! Get out of my face! Carter: Peter, that's the first time any of us have ever beaten Ted. Bill Gates: Yeah. How did you know he was bluffing? Peter: Well, when he lies, he blinks twice. I first noticed it when he did that Barbara Walters interview, and he said he'd be with Jane Fonda forever. Bill Gates: Well, I'm gonna turn in. Michael Eisner: Yeah. Me, too. I gotta be at Disneyland before it opens. We're ethnically cleansing the ""Small World"" ride. Peter: Come on. You guys practically run this country. There's gotta be a ton of fun stuff we could do. Bill Gates: All right! Peter: Oh, man! There's a tollbooth. Hey, anybody got a quarter? Bill Gates: What's a quarter? Peter: Well, we gotta give him something. [All laughing] Peter: Man, looking up at the sky just makes you feel so small. Bill Gates: Yeah. I mean, if God created all this, who created God? Michael Eisner: Maybe he created himself. Peter: Or herself. Think about that. Bill Gates: Neat. This guy's deep, Carter. Where'd you find him? Carter: He's my son-in-law. [Cell phone rings] Bill Gates: Okay, honey. I gotta go, you want a ride? Michael Eisner: Sure. Peter: Wow! Carter: Peter, I actually had a good time with you tonight. And I just want to say-well-I'm glad you married my daughter. Peter: Thank you, Jesus. Jesus: Actually, it wasn't me. It was... Vishnu: No, no. It's okay. I'm used to it. Carter: Having fun, Peter? Peter: You bet. I put all my poker winnings on your dog, Mr. P. Brian: Dog? Carter: You got nothing to worry about. Seabreeze is a sure thing. Brian: Seabreeze? Chris: Dad, where are the jockeys? Peter: They're all in the laundry, son. I'm going Indian today. Lois: Come on, Seabreeze! Peter: Yeah! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Brian: [shuddering] Lois: What's Brian doing? Meg: Oh, my God! Carter: He's violating Seabreeze! Peter: No, no, he's just awkwardly positioning himself-now he's violating Seabreeze. Stewie: [Making funky porn-style music] Brian: Mr. Pewterschmidt, again, I just want to tell you how sorry I am about this. I don't know what came over me. Carter: You had better not have ruined my race dog! Peter: Brian, I am very disappointed in you! I'd turn my back on you, but I've seen what you do in that situation. Now, if you'll excuse me, Carter and I have a polio match to attend. Carter: Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor? Veternarian: She's fine. Seabreeze will be able to race again. But, unfortunately, not for another nine weeks. She's pregnant. Brian: Look, Mr. Pewterschmidt, I just want you to know, I am going to do the right thing here. Carter: You're not doing anything! In fact, you're never going to see Seabreeze again! All of you, pack your things and get out! Peter:I am never speaking to you again. Don't worry, Mr. Pewterschmidt. I have a plan. I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting it on with your dog. Everybody stand back. [wailing] Oh, boy. Oh, God. Ah. [front door] Peter: Mr. Pewterschmidt, please? Can we still be pals? See, look. I made a picture of you and me out of glue and macaroni. Carter: Wow, Peter! That means a lot to me because you made it. Peter: Really? Carter: No! Get out of here! Veternarian: Mr. Pewterschmidt! Seabreeze is gone! Carter: What? Lois: I can't find Brian. Carter: Peter, you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off with my Seabreeze? Peter: I think I have an idea. [sobbing] Man: This is the room. The light switch is here. It's mostly for show. There's your Murphy bed. Don't mind the Epsteins. They keep to themselves. Mrs. Epstein: We're going to see Bobby Darin at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie? Mr. Epstein: Bobby Darin tomorrow. Man: This is the bathroom. But watch out. We got some bad roaches here. Roach 1: You're on our turf, man! Roach 2: Man, I cut you! I cut you up so bad, you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad. Brian: Those are bad roaches. Man: I blame the schools. [Mysterious instrumental music] Brian: Were you followed? Lois: Don't worry. I've got a decoy. Quagmire: Hi, Lois. Hubba-hubba. Whoa, Lois! You put on a few, huh? Chris: Well, I never! Stewie: That's all right, honey. I don't think he was the one anyway. Now, let's go get sundaes. Lois: You know, we all really miss you. And Peter talks about you all the time. Brian: Oh, really? Anything nice? Lois: No. Brian: So, he's still mad, huh? Lois: Well, I should go. Here. Take this. It's probably not a good idea for us to meet anymore. Daddy swore he'd track you down any way he could. [Dramatic instrumental music] Michael Eisner: Bingo! Bill Gates: I told you she'd lead us to him. Let's call Pewterschmidt. Michael Eisner: No, wait. Let's take the jetpacks! Bill Gates: Cool! Michael Eisner: Man! The people look like ants from up here. Bill Gates: They are ants, Michael. They are ants. Tricia Takanawa: This is Tricia Takanawa reporting live, where police have discovered the whereabouts of Seabreeze, the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune. The dognapper has been traced to this sleazy motel. Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker is already on the scene. Prostitute: Who's that, baby? Tom Tucker: Hello, this is Tom Tucker's...evil twin, Todd Tucker out to destroy his brother's reputation. [fake evil laugh] I'm going back inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes. Now, back to this breaking news. [Suspenseful instrumental music] Lois: Brian, please, eat something. Brian: Why bother? My face is plastered all over the news. Your father won't let me see the dog who's carrying my puppies. And my best friend is going to incredible lengths to ignore me. Lois: Brian, don't let him get to you. Peter, come out of that thing! Brian: He can't hear you, Lois. Besides, it's not him that's getting to me, it's your father. Lois: I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn. I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to take good care of the puppies though. Brian: Well, you know, they're not his to take care of. They're my kids! And I'm gonna get them back. My father wasn't there for me, but dammit I'm gonna be there for my kids! I'm gonna sue your dad for custody! [Solemn instrumental music] Lois: Daddy, please, stop this. Brian has every right to see his puppies when they're born. Carter: Sorry, pumpkin. Lois: I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for this! Carter: Oh, you'll be fine. You're just having your period. Judge: This court will now come to order. Lawyer: Brian, do you like children? Brian: I love children. That's why I'm here. I want the opportunity to raise my puppies. Lawyer: Do you remember an incident at a South Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996? Brian: Yeah, I guess. Baby [Baby screaming] Brian: [screaming back] You like that? You like that? [Screaming] You just tune this out, don't you? Well, tune this out! [Screaming] [Both scream] Brian: Shut up! <back in court> Look, I was angry because my Moon Over Mi-hammy was overcooked... Lawyer: I also have your rental records from the Quahog Video Store. Can you read the last two titles, please? Brian: Son-In-Law and Bio-dome. Lawyer: And who's the star of those films? Brian: Pauly Shore. Lawyer: Pauly Shore! Man: He's terrible! Brian: But I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the video store for taping over their movies. [Mysterious music on TV] Charles Foster Kane: Rosebud. [Dramatic music on TV] Peter: It's his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid. There. I just saved you two long, boobless hours. Lawyer: How convenient! Blame it on someone else. Is that the kind of man we want raising these puppies? Brian: Peter? You got to believe me, Your Honor. Carter: Uh, Peter, I'm putting together another card game. You in? Peter: You want me to play? Carter: Absolutely. But first I want you to testify against that horny mutt of yours. Peter: I don't know if I can do that. Carter: Ooh, that's too bad. Because Bill and Michael really want to see you again. They're coming over later, and Bill's going to bring his Stretch Armstrong. Peter: Oh, man! And his arms stretch out to next week! Carter: Your Honor, Peter Griffin would like to take the stand. Lawyer: Mr. Griffin, which of the following two phrases best describes Brian Griffin? ""Problem drinker"" or ""African-American haberdasher""? Peter: I guess ""problem drinker."" But that's... Lawyer: Thank you. ""Sexual deviant"" or ""magic picture that you stare at till you see something""? Peter: ""Sexual deviant,"" but that other one's... Lawyer: Thank you. Isn't it true that you told my client, Carter Pewterschmidt, that Brian is a menace to society and should never be allowed to see his children? [All gasping] [Suspenseful instrumental music] Peter: Brian should be allowed to see his puppies! Carter: Peter, think about what you're doing. Peter: I am. Your Honor, Brian'll be a great dad. Hell, if I was half the parent Brian is, I'd know that Chris's favorite ice cream is... Brian: Chocolate-chip. Peter: And Stewie's favorite bedtime story is... Brian: Goodnight, Moon. Peter: And Meg's real father's name is... Brian: Stan Thompson. Meg: [Pop music on headphones] Judge: I've heard enough. I do believe that Brian would be a successful parent. However, if he was to repeat his actions at the dog track he would be setting a bad example for his puppies. Therefore, I grant Brian custody with the condition that he be neutered first. Peter: Yeah! You did it, buddy! Congratulations! Oh, man! What does ""neutered"" mean? Brian: You're almost there, Seabreeze. Oh, and, also, I didn't bring this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them. Carter: You know, Brian, it occurs to me that this is like a Greek tragedy where a man must choose between himself and his children. Of course, you'll be playing the role of ""Sans Testaclese."" Veternarian: We're ready for you, down the hall. Peter: Are you sure you want to go through with this, Brian? Because you could have puppies with another dog. Oh, maybe with a condor! Then you'd have flying puppies. Would you like that, Brian? Flying puppies? Brian: No, Peter. Those puppies in there are mine. And I'll give anything to be with them. Anything. Peter: I am not looking forward to what you'll be like once they do this to you. Brian: I love chocolate! But I can't eat it, because then I'll get fat. But it's so good! Veternarian: Are you ready, Brian? Brian: I guess so. Lois: Stop! Brian, come quick! Brian: Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies! Peter: Well, then whose are they? [All barking] Carter: You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore! Lois: You must be so relieved. Brian: Well, actually, I was kind of looking forward to being a dad. Peter: Don't worry. There'll be other chances. Peter: You know what's funny? I always thought that dogs laid eggs. And I learned something today. [closing theme music]"
Theme Song Lois," Peter, this is ridiculous. I know you're upset about losing your job, but you've been sitting on that couch for two weeks. Peter: I have not, Lois. Brian: He's right. It's actually been more like...yeah, 13 days. Lois: Well you at least have do something other than sitting there eating. Peter: All right, all right. Brian, let's go for a walk. [Forklift beeping] Meg: [Sobbing] Lois: Meg, sweetheart, what's wrong? Meg: My life. That's what's wrong. I was totally humiliated at school today. Principal Shepherd: Okay, we're gonna do a little informal survey here, kids. Would those of you going away for spring break please move to the left of the room? [Repeats request in Spanish] Lois: Oh, Meg, what do those kids know? Meg: They know how to have a good time. Lois: Well, so do we. I'll tell you what. How about you and I have our own little spring break? We'll go to that fancy new spa that just opened up in Warwick. Massages and facials. Ah! It'll be great. What do you say? Meg: I guess it couldn't be worse than last year when we all went to Sea World. Lois: [Laughing] Peter: And how long has this been going on? [down at the docks] Peter: Lois is right. I've been out of work too long. Brian: I think you should find something you really enjoy doing. Take those guys out there, for example. Peter: Where? Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job. Fresh sea air, working outside. That's how a real New England man makes a living. Brian: Well, maybe that's something to think about, Peter. Jake Tucker: What's that, Daddy? Tom Tucker: That's Mercury, Jake. The planet closest to the sun. What it's doing down here by the wharf, I haven't the foggiest. We should probably ask a scientist... Peter: I'm a guy, you jackass! [Griffin yard] Peter: Yeah, that feels good. Lois: Chris, don't forget to mist under his chins. Stewie: Oh, boy, Lois! It's a real mess down there. I'm afraid I not going to be able to do this in the time I quoted you earlier. Peter: Chris, shut the hose off for a second. Everybody, I have an announcement. I am gonna drop this weight and rejoin the workforce. I have decided to become a professional fisherman. Lois: What? Why a fisherman? Peter: It makes perfect sense, Lois. You know how much time I've spent on the ocean. [Peter as castaway, adrift on raft] Peter: Wilson! What are we gonna do now? Wilson! Wilson! Voit: My name is Voit, dumb ass. Stewie: Hello, Doreen? Yeah, I'm still over at the Griffin job. Listen, tell Walter I'm not going to be able to make it to the construction site. I don't know. Have him send Frank, or Glen, or Harelip Steve. I know, it creeps me out, too. Peter: So you think I can find a boat here, huh, Joe? Joe: Yeah. You wouldn't believe what we confiscate from these crooks. Auctioneer: Welcome. We open today's bidding with this pair of panties confiscated from a prostitute. Quagmire: $50! Auctioneer: She had nine STDs. Quagmire: $45. Auctioneer: And when we caught her, she wet herself. Quagmire: $50. Cleveland: Excuse me. Are you gonna sell anything that's not gross? Auctioneer: And now our next item. Please direct your attention to this photo of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat. Peter: Oh, man! That's perfect! Man: $12,000! Peter: $13,000! Man 2: $25,000! Peter: [Whimpering] Auctioneer: Sold for $25,000! Man 2: Yes! Peter: Crap! Man 2: Thanks. Auctioneer: And now the actual boat itself. Do I have an opening bid for the boat? Peter: $50,000! Auctioneer: Sold for $50,000! Joe: Good for you, Peter. [Applause] [One person clapping] Shamus: Congratulations. You've just bought yourself a cursed boat. Peter: Cursed? Shamus: The last captain of that vessel lost his life. And it weren't no accident! His name was Salty. And he was devoured by Daggermouth, the man-eating blowfish. You want to buy that boat? Go ahead. But don't expect me to fish your dead body from an angry sea that gave you fair warning. Peter: Are you up for bids, too? You are just precious. Lois: Are you gonna miss me? Peter: Only until I go to the newsstand and buy a Hustler. Lois: All right, I left you the number for the spa. See you in a few days. Meg: Not if I strangle myself with a seaweed wrap and die. Peter: You are dark! Brian: Peter, you haven't told me how you expect to pay for that boat. Peter: Don't worry, Brian. There's got to be 100 banks that'll give me a loan. [Gunfire and screaming] Peter: Wow! So, you can really give me a loan? Jim Kaplan: I sure can. You see, Mr. Griffin, what sets us apart from other banks is that other banks are banks. Now, I trust you have collateral. Peter: Um, I got three kids. Jim Kaplan: I'll take them. Just kidding. Or maybe I'm not. Sign this. Here you go. Good luck! [Bell ringing] Jim Kaplan: So, what do you want on your thigh? Biker: I want a skull. Jim Kaplan: Okay. Well, I can draw Kermit the Frog. How about a nice Kermit the Frog? Biker: No. I want a skull. Jim Kaplan: Okay, well, I'm gonna go ahead and do Kermit the Frog. Meg: Mom, this is so lame. Lois: Come on, Meg. Try to have fun. I promise after a few days here you won't even remember the words ""spring break"". How about some TV? MTV VJ: This is MTV and we're rocking at spring break! VH1 VJ: This is VH1 and we're rocking at spring break. Bernard Shaw: ...leaving thousands injured. For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw...keeping it real and kicking ass at spring break! Whoo! Meg: [sighing] Peter: There she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and the Incredible Hulk Put Together. Hennessey: Yes, she's a fine vessel. Welcome to the wharf. Name's Hennessey. Peter: Hi there. Peter Griffin. My friends call me Peter for short. Hennessey: I'll let you in on a little secret, neighbor. The best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71. Keep that to yourself. Peter: Oh, wow! Thanks. I'll see you, fellows. I got some fish to catch. Let's see. Latitude 42, longitude 71. This is it. What the hell? Boy: Papa, he killed Mordecai the Dancing Yiddish Clown! Father: Stop crying! You just became a man. Now, act like one! Peter: Hey, Hennessey, what's the big idea sending me to that Bar Mitzvah? Hennessey: Because I don't like you! And I don't like your face! We don't need any more fishermen crowding up this wharf! Peter: Oh, well, fine, Hennessey! You want an enemy, you got one! Hennessey: Fine! Stewie: There we are. Hey, Steve, you ever think of growing a moustache? Hennessey: Nice fish you got there, Griffin. What are you selling? Your bait? Peter: Nice face, Hennessey. Yes! Me, one. You, zero. Hey! Man: Wow! How do you do it? Peter: You're very nice to ask. First I hang the old worm out there. They usually go for it. So, I jerk them around a little. They fight for a while. And then they just lay back and accept it. Man: How about we get together later? Peter: Um, okay. What the hell? Oh, damn it! Hey! What's going on here? Brian: Peter, did you read the fine print on this loan contract? Peter: If by ""read"" you mean ""imagined a naked lady,"" then yes. Brian: Peter, listen, the bank's taking all our stuff. And according to this if you don't pay them within 48 hours, they get the house, too. Chris: Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank! Lois: Meg, Did I ever tell you that if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic it makes it not work? Because no one told me. I thought you should know. Meg: Look, Mom, I don't really feel like talking right now. Okay? Lois: Fine. I just don't understand why we had to leave the spa so early. Meg: Look, I just want to go home and spend the next three days in solitary confinement where I belong! Lois: [sighing] Well, I tried. Meg: Mom, what the hell are we doing here? Lois: This is where you wanted to be. Right, honey? Meg: Yeah. But not with you! Spring Breaker: Hey, did you hear what happened to the dude from UMass? He got so drunk he fell off his hotel balcony! He's in a coma! Spring Breaker 2: Oh, man! I want to party with him! Spring Breaker: You know it! Yeah! Spring Breakers: [Intense hollering] Connie: Hey, look. Meg made it, you guys. Cool girl: Yeah. And she brought her mommy. Meg: Oh, my God! Lois: Come on, Meg! Get out of the car! Like the kids say, up your nose with a rubber hose! Spring Breaker: Hey, look, everybody. It's Spuds MacKenzie! [Screaming] Brian: That's the last of the furniture. Peter: No TV. I miss my friends. John Ritter, and Florence Henderson, and Alfonso Ribeiro. Brian: Is he the guy from Silver Spoons? Peter: Um, no, well, he was on French Prince of Bel-Air.... Brian: Fresh Prince. Peter: Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But I don't know if he was also on... Hey, Alfonso. Alfonso Ribeiro: Yeah? Peter: Were you on Silver Spoons? Alfonso Ribeiro: Yes, I was. Peter: Oh, there you go. Lois: Come on. Just a little higher, honey. Meg: Mom, I don't think I can... Spring Breaker: Hey, who's holding Lois? Spring Breaker 2: I don't know. Some dude named Mel. Carson Daly: This is Carson Daly. And we're live here at spring break. Who wants to party? Okay, one, two, three, four, five.... Okay, we're gonna need cake and juice for 14 people. All right, now let's go to Tom Green who's gonna do something really outrageous! Tom Green: Does anyone out there like me yet? Can I stop this? Peter: Hey, what the hell are you doing in my house? Jim: Your house? This is my house. My wife and I bought it from the bank. Peter: I still got another day to pay back the loan. Jim: The bank said it wouldn't matter because you're a fat deadbeat loser. Peter: Fat deadbeat loser? Well, sir, while I may not agree with what you say, I'll defend to the death your right to say it. Abby: There we are. It's a van Gogh print. Isn't it beautiful? Stewie: Oh, yes, I've often fantasized about what this house would be like with more culture. [Griffin men all in morning coats and top hats] Stewie: The port is quite good. Brian: Quite good. Chris: Indeed. Peter: Most certainly. Brian: What year is it? Chris: '51. Peter: Ah. Stewie: Delectable. Brian: Indeed. Chris: Yes. Peter: Oh, dear! Brian: What is it? Peter: I've spontaneously combusted. Stewie: well, I am Sorry. Peter: Oh, it's quite all right. I'm tired of living. Stewie: Ah, very good then. Chris: For the best. Brian: Yes, indeed. Stewie: Is it raining again? Rabbi: Did you hear the one about us? Connie: Wow! You are such a good dancer. Cool girl: Way to go on that beer bong. Cool guy: Yeah, no fake. No fake. Meg: Mom! Lois: Hey! What are you doing here? Meg: What am I doing here? I've been waiting out here for hours! Lois: What? Meg: You were supposed to pop inside ""real quick"" and find someone who looked enough like me so I could use their ID. And then you were supposed to come out and give me the ID so I could get inside. Lois: What? Meg: God, it's like talking to a 3-year-old! Lois: Oh, you know what? You need to learn how to loosen up a little, toots. Meg: Yeah, I get the feeling you're loose enough for us both. Lois: What? Meg: Nothing. Lois: That's right nothing. Don't you sass me! [Phone ringing] Chris: Good evening. Stevenson residence. Meg: Chris, honey, we've been over this a thousand times. It's pronounced ""Griffin."" Chris: Hi, Mom! Lois: Hi, Chris. Put your father on. Chris: Hey, Dad? Jim: And the French guy says, ""Deodorant? What's that?"" Stewie: All right. All right. I've got one. I've got one. Okay. Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates. Oh, God, wait! How did that one go? Oh, well, anyway, it turns out they're Siegfried and Roy. I'm no good at telling jokes. Chris: Dad, it's Mom. Peter: Oh, God! Please be Somerset Maugham. Please be Somerset Maugham. Hello? Lois: Peter? Peter: Damn! Lois: I was just calling to check in with my boys, see how you guys are doing. Peter: We're fine. Lois: What's all the noise? Peter: Nothing. Nothing. [plays tape recording of Lois speaking] ""Peter, I need you to take out the trash!"" Okay, Lois! Lois, I got to go! Holy crap, Brian! What am I gonna do? Lois is gonna be home in a couple of days and we're getting kicked out of the house tomorrow. Brian: What do you suggest? Peter: Get out your ring. Brian: Peter, that's not gonna... Peter: Come on! Both: Wonder Twin powers, activate! Peter: Form of steam! Brian: Peter, we got these in a box of Franken Berry. Jim: A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks like a jackal! Jackal? Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal? Abby: Time! Stewie: It wasn't right the first time you said it! Why the hell would it be right the next 10 times? God! Peter: Oh, man, I am screwed! I'm gonna lose my house, and my boat, and everything. How am I gonna come up with $50,000 by tomorrow? Quagmire: Well, you could whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for $50 apiece. Or 50 really fat chicks for $1,000. What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks need love, too. But they got to pay. Peter: What is this? Waitress: Sea water, courtesy of that gentleman over there. Hennessey: You need $50,000, Griffin? I got a suggestion for you. Why don't you kill Daggermouth? Peter: Maybe I will, Hennessey. Shamus: You'd be buying yourself a one-way ticket to a watery grave. Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless creature that's ever inhabited the sea. Legend has it he dwells out by Fish Stench Cove. He'll kill any man that comes near there. I saw him once. Sure I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye was infected that day from picking at it, and I was tired, and I'd been swimming in a pool with too much chlorine, and that was the hour my glasses were at Lenscrafters but I seen that fish! Peter: If there's $50,000 in it, I don't think I got a choice. Shamus: You can whore yourself out to 1,000 fat chicks for $50. Quagmire: Nah, nah, we covered that. Hennessey: You ain't got a chance, Griffin. Daggermouth killed my friend Salty. And he was twice the fisherman you are. And half the weight! Peter: Hey-no! No! Hot! Joe: He's right, Peter. It'd be suicide to go after that fish. There's gotta be another way. Cleveland: We could have a bake sale. Quagmire: Oh, now, see, I think that's a neat idea. Peter: No! I am not gonna let my family live on the street. Not even if it means ending up like Shamus here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. Quagmire: So, were you like, in an accident, or what? Shamus: No. Me father was a tree. Peter: What's wrong with me? I got to be crazy to think I can kill that man-eating fish. I mean, what the hell am I doing? Jim: Hey, hey, hey, come on, Peter. What kind of talk is that? Abby: Yeah, you can do it. Who's my big brave boy, huh? Peter: Me. Abby: Who's my big brave boy? Peter: Me. Abby: [blowing raspberries on Peter's stomach] [Rock music playing] Meg: This sucks, Mom. Lois: Meg, stop moping. These are the best years of your life. Now, let's get up there and live a little, huh? Meg: Mom, I look like an idiot! Lois: No, you don't. Come on. Just move your hips a little like this. Crowd: [Chanting] Lois! Lois! Lois! Lois: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Crowd: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Lois: Atta girl! Shake your moneymaker! Crowd: Meg! Meg! Meg! Man: Oh, my God! It's a chick! school janitor: [Repeating in Spanish] Cop: All right, everybody! This party's over! Man: Why do you cops always have to kill our buzz? Cop: He used a teenage colloquialism. Get the tear gas. [Screaming] Joe: Not so fast, big guy. Peter: What are you guys doing here? Cleveland: We're gonna help you kill the fish. Peter: But this is gonna be dangerous. We could all die. Quagmire: Oh, come on. You're our best friend, Peter. Besides, I can remember a time when you saved all our butts. Peter: Yeah, too bad I didn't get there until after the sodomy. All right, let's go kick some fish ass! [Lively cheering] [Siren wailing] Meg: I can't believe I just showed everyone my tater tots. Worst of all, now I'm gonna have a police record. Lois: Now, Meg, if you're gonna grab ahold of life, you've gotta expect to get your hands dirty once in a while. Meg: It was kind of cool that people noticed me. Lois: That's the spirit, honey. Okay, one, two, three, tuck and roll! Peter: We're right on course, guys. Give me another beer. Joe: You know, these are the precious moments. The four of us out at sea, miles away from civilization, tossing back brews. Peter: Amen to that, Joe. Hey, you guys, here's one for you. Let's say none of us were married, all right? If you could have any woman in the world, who would it be? Joe: Mariel Hemingway. Peter: Come on. Really? Cleveland: Not a very good choice. Quagmire: She's jagged. Joe: No. I think she's very attractive in a classical kind of way. Quagmire: Yeah, but you could cut a roast on her face. Cleveland: I would go with Margaret Thatcher. All: Margaret Thatcher? Peter: Why the hell Margaret Thatcher? Cleveland: Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy? Not one of you finds power sexy? Joe: How about you, Peter? Peter: Oh, like you got to ask. The chick with three knockers from Total Recall. Joe: Interesting. Cleveland: I never saw that movie. Quagmire: Hey, you know one was papier-mâché, right? Peter: Oh, jeez, can I change my answer? Of course I know it's paper! I don't care! What's wrong with you? What about you, Quagmire? Quagmire: Taylor Hanson. Joe: Taylor Hanson's a guy. Quagmire: You guys are yanking me. Hey, let's put one over on old Quagmire. Peter: No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire. Quagmire: Well, well, this is insane! That's impossible! Oh, my God, Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God! I got all these magazines. Oh, God! Oh, God! [Suspenseful instrumental music] Joe: [gasping] This must be Fish Stench Cove. Peter: All right. Now all we got to do is find the fish. Terry Jones: I wonder where that fish did go. A fish, a fish, a fishy, oh. Joe: I heard that when Daggermouth eats you, he devours your guts first. Cleveland: I heard he doesn't just eat you, he eats your soul! Peter: I heard one of Shannen Doherty's eyes is off-center 'cause it's trying to escape! Daggermouth: Welcome, gentlemen! Quagmire: It's him! Quick, shoot him! Daggermouth: Not so fast! Perhaps I could offer you a glass of port. And you a glass of starboard. That's a little nautical joke. I'm a fish, you see. I'm also delightfully mad. Oh dear, would you mind holding still for a moment? These antique pistols take about ten minutes to reload. Joe: Peter, catch! Peter: Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe! Cleveland: Peter, shoot him! Peter: Oh, yeah. Right. My God! Isn't it amazing that that's what we all look like on the inside? Salty: It's a robot, you idiot. Joe: Who are you? Salty: I'm Salty. Peter: Salty? But everybody said you were killed by that fish. Salty: That's what I wanted them to think. I disappeared and spread the Daggermouth rumor myself. Peter: Why? Salty: Merchandise! Daggermouth t-shirts, mugs, posters. And I'm in talks with Nickelodeon for a cartoon show. Figured I'd pair him with an effeminate cat. What do you think? Peter: I'd watch that. Joe: Sure, sure Quagmire: Me, too. Cleveland: Sounds like a good balance. Salty: And now I'm gonna give you $50,000 to be on your way. Peter: $50,000? For what? Salty: To keep your mouth shut! And because the longer we stay here the more people'll question how a fisherman with no engineering background managed to build a sophisticated talking fish robot. Lois: Honey, I'm really sorry for how I acted. Getting so drunk, and ditching you at the bar and letting those boys take pictures of you while you were sleeping. I was so busy having fun, I guess I kind of ruined it for you. [Car honking] Lois: Uh-oh, we got company. Meg: Looks like your fans are back, Mom. Cool kids: Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Lois: No, I think this one's all yours. [Cheering] Cool girl: You go, girl! Cool boy 1: All right! Cool boy 2: One's an innie, and one's an outie. Announcer: And now, back to Daggermouth and Boom Boom on Nickelodeon. Daggermouth: Boom Boom, did you do your exercises today? Boom Boom: Yes. I did 20 laps. And I'm about to do 20 more! Daggermouth: Oh, you! Boom Boom: Yipes! [Whimsical instrumental music] Lois: Oh, Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman is working out for you. You know I gotta admit I half expected to come home, and all our stuff would be gone, and we'd owe somebody a whole lot of money. Peter: How can you ""half expect"" something? Lois: I don't know. It's just a turn of phrase. Peter: How do you ""turn a phrase""? Lois: God, you're dumb! Thank God for that ass! Now, come here and kiss me. Good night, honey. Peter: Good night, Lois. Good night, Jim and Abby. Jim & Abby: Good night. [Abby blowing raspberries] Peter: [laughing] Not now, Abby. [closing theme music]"
Diane Simmons," Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development tonight, as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of the real killer. But first..."
Tom Tucker," It's fall! The time of year when the leaves turn that pretty, purpley-orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade."
Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they're choosing this year's theme.
Tricia Takanawa," Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme is ""Ten Commandments"" star, Charlton Heston."
Charlton Heston, Let my pigeons go!
Tricia Takanawa, He nailed one! We have our theme!
Cleveland," I submitted ""togetherness."" A simple theme. But powerful, nonetheless."
Joe," Come on, ""overcoming adversity""! Let's go, ""overcoming adversity""!"
Quagmire," Show me ""women I gave the clap to""! Oh!"
Charlton Heston," And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: ""The episode of 'Who's the Boss?' where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower."""
Peter, Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering]
Stewie," Oh! Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead...yet. ""Michael Flatley."""
Lois," Peter, it's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric?"
Peter, Esoteric?
Peter," Lois, ""Who's the Boss?"" is not a food."
Brian, Swing and a miss.
Meg," I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!"
Peter," What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her-"
Lois," Peter! Honey, what happened?"
Meg," Well, it was lunchtime and..."
 Canner," Meg, let me tell you about popularity."
 Canner, Bye!
Meg," Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag."
Peter," I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?"
Meg," More like $1,100."
Peter, [Laughing] You wish I loved you that much!
Meg, [Sighs]
Peter," We're never gonna get this float done in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys!"
Joe," Peter, your theme is a dud."
Cleveland," Yeah. I've never even seen ""Who's the Boss?"""
Quagmire, Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00...and home by 11:00. Oh!
Peter," But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. Quagmire, you're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies."
Quagmire," Gemini. Augh! Capricorn. Augh! Well, I know you're not a Virgo! Augh!! Hey, from down here, you look like a Pisces! Augh!!!"
Peter," And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots, I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none of them were half the man you are. And since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure."
Joe," Peter's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in?"
Quagmire," Go, Spooner Street!"
Kevin," My dad always says, ""Measure twice, cut once."""
Kevin, We didn't measure! We didn't measure!
Brian," Amazing, Peter, you've inspired the whole neighborhood to work together."
Peter," You know what's really amazing, Brian? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing."
Meg," Hey, Stewie, if I had a job, I could buy the bag myself."
Stewie, Hmmm. I squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano; I suppose I could as well.
Stewie," All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified."
Richard, Augh! I don't want to play the piano!
Stewie, Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon?
Girl, [Playing bassoon] [Screams]
Flappy," No experience? No, thanks."
Lois, [Sighs]
Waitress, [Whispering]
Flappy," Oh, nuts. Young lady! What's the little guy's name?"
Meg, What do you care?
Flappy," Well, I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job."
Meg, Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.
Stewie, [spits out cookie]
Diane Simmons," Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom?"
Tom Tucker," Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...and clipped onto this piece of wood is a list of this year's float entries."
Diane Simmons," Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam."
Tom Tucker, And here's our first float.
Diane Simmons," Oh, looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom."
Tom Tucker, Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.
Diane Simmons, Mmm-hmm.
Tom Tucker," This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. Well, that's just plain wrong."
Diane Simmons, Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them-
Tom Tucker," Oh, baby! Look at that!"
Joe," Peter, the float turned out great."
Peter," Yeah, our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire figured out how to get us free cable."
Cleveland, We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax.
Diane Simmons, First place goes to Spooner Street.
All, [Cheering] We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter]
Loretta, Come on now! This is damn foolish!
Peter," My theme, my trophy!"
Quagmire," My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself, Peter! I'm the boss!"
Cleveland," Well, he said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due."
Bonnie," Joe, my feet are starting to swell."
Joe, You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little you have to eat when your legs don't work.
Peter," There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No, no, no, wait a minute, this is crazy. You first."
Brian," Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy."
Peter," Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!"
Lois," Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it."
Cleveland, Here's to togetherness!
Peter, Car. Car! Car!
Flappy," Meg, order up!"
Waitress," Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself."
Stewie, I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
Waitress, Try them. You'll like them.
Stewie," Yes, well, I rather doubt that. I-oh. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you!"
Woman, What a precious little boy.
Meg," Oh, that's my-uh, son."
Woman," Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip."
Meg, $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you have a seat next to my little baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
Stewie, [Belching] Ha!
Peter, [Horrified scream]
Lois," Peter, what is it?"
Cleveland, What's going on out here?
Joe," Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry."
Charlton Heston," That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [moaning]"
Quagmire," What's all the noise, boys? I was just jerk-ed out of a sound sleep."
Cleveland, Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
Quagmire, Maybe it fell.
Peter, Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.
Bonnie, You think one of us stole it?
Peter," I never said the word ""stole."" Looks like someone has a guilty conscience."
Joe, Guilty conscience! Ha! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable.
Bonnie, Oooh.
Cleveland," Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!"
ALL, Oooh.
Quagmire, You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy.
ALL, Oooh.
Loretta," He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the damned time, you could do it yourself, like the law says you should."
ALL, Oooh.
Peter," Oh, it's on now!"
Joe, Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along!
Peter, I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.
Lois, Peter!
Peter, What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Bonnie," Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them."
Lois, I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.
Quagmire, I don't like the look of her!
Rod Serling, I offer you a recipe. Combine one part small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The Twi-
Peter, Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
Joe," Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?"
Quagmire, Come back here!
Meg," Well, I'm off to work."
Peter," Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, Lois, and I'm gonna find out who."
Meg, I'm taking Stewie with me again.
Lois," Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick!"
Peter," For crying out loud, we played Pictionary with them!"
Lois, Bastards!
Stewie," Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Hiya!"
Meg," Well, bye."
Lois, And to think they used to be our best friends!
Peter, That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. And that's a lamp. And you have boobies. And I'm gonna find that trophy!
Joe," Well, to be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over."
Peter," Well, we realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy."
Peter," Oh, there's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [forced laughter]"
Peter," Damn, it's not here!"
Peter, Not here either.
Peter, Huh. Nothing.
Lois," Oh, my God! We were robbed!"
Peter, Is anything missing?
Lois," No. I don't think so. Hey, where's that picture of me in my two-piece at the Cape?"
Chris, Should I call the cops?
Peter," No, I'm guessing a cop may have had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war!"
Lois, Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.
Peter," Do you guys have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?"
Clerk, Land mines?
 Lois, Land mines.
Peter, It was land mines.
Peter, Quagmire.
Quagmire, Peter.
Joe, Cleveland.
Cleveland, Joe.
Lois, Bonnie.
Bonnie, Lois.
Quagmire, Cleveland.
Joe, Lois.
Cleveland, Bonnie.
Lois, Quagmire.
Bonnie, Peter.
Loretta, [Clears throat]
Cleveland, Loretta.
Lois," Come on, Peter."
Peter, That ought to slow them down.
Meg," Being a single mother is hard. But the real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. Right, Stewie?"
Stewie," What's that? Oh, yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!"
Meg," This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Well, here's your check. God bless."
Waitress," Here, honey."
Stewie," What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my.... Oh, that's better than sex!"
Sandy Balfour," Oh, and could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby."
Lois, What are they up to?
Peter," Well, Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day."
Joe, Freeze!
Kevin, Dad?
Joe, Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
Kevin," Thanks, Dad."
Joe, Look out for your mother!
Bonnie," There's a sandwich on the counter, honey."
Loretta," Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders."
Cleveland," Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks."
Sandy Balfour, Hello.
Quagmire," Hey, get the hell off my...well, hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass."
Sandy Balfour," Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins."
Quagmire," The Griffins! A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me! All right. No! No, no! It's not all right!"
Cleveland, The Griffins are not to be trusted.
Loretta, Mmm-mmm.
Joe," Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum."
Bonnie, And their carpet and drape scheme...[finger down throat]
Stewie," No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me!"
Lois, But you love mashed turkey and peas.
Stewie," I'm sorry. What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love? Hmm? Write this down, you toad-faced frump. I love pancakes!"
Sandy Balfour," Hi, little fella. Is Meg Griffin here?"
Lois," No, she's not."
Sandy Balfour," Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home."
Lois, What?
Stewie," For God's sake, feed me!"
Sandy Balfour, Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child!
Lois, How dare you! This is a wonderful home!
Peter," Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!"
Quagmire," Hey, shut up!"
Sandy Balfour," Honey, would you like some pancakes?"
Stewie," Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!"
Lois, Stewie!
Meg," Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new..."
Lois," Oh, Meg, a woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food!"
Meg," Dog food, huh?"
Lois," Meg, is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week?"
Meg, It's easy...when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [laughing nervously]
Peter," Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager?"
Lois," She's 16, Peter."
Peter, You knew about this?
Sarah," Welcome to your new foster home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters."
Hispanic baby," Hola, Stewie."
Chinese baby," Ni hao, Stewie."
African baby, [click click] Stewie.
Stewie, Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!
 Stevens," I promise, it'll never happen again."
Clerk," I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!"
Chris, So this is where babies come from?
Brian," Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from."
Chris, You told me I came out of your vagina!
Clerk, Next!
Peter," Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins."
Clerk," Griffin, Griffin...I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork."
Lois, Well look harder! I want my baby back!
Peter," Lois, Lois, please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin. We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. Jeez, I never was any good at dealing with the authorities."
Peter," Don't worry, Brian. I know how to handle this."
Cop," Sir, are you aware you were going 50 in.... I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down, sir."
Peter," Ah, crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island."
Stewie, [screams angrily] Damn it! I want pancakes! You people understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes! Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!
Sarah," Poor little guy. ""Pancakes"" must be street for ""crack."" Damn those parents of his."
Jack," Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?"
Chinese baby," Stewie, come complete our rainbow!"
Stewie," I've got a better idea. Let's go play ""swallow the stuff under the sink."""
Lois, You lied to them!
Peter, You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
Bonnie," Um, actually, I said Satan. That's a typo."
Quagmire, We didn't know who that woman was! It's not our fault!
Lois, No? Then whose fault is it?
Brian," It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships."
Lois," Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on. Well, now we have a real problem to deal with."
Peter, That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax. Joe? ...And we have to get Stewie back! I remembered.
Cleveland," Well, we're here to help. And we must get our baby back."
Joe, Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world! Rock their world!
ALL, Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it!
Sarah, See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home. All races living together in harmony and love.
Stewie, Pancakes!
Sarah, He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs hugs!
Stewie, Doorbell! Doorbell!
Cleveland," Hi. We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club. Is there something missing in yourlife?"
Jack," You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual!"
Bonnie," They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers. When I get him home, I swear to God I'm gonna grease up..."
Lois," That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris."
Chris," Here we go, Dad!"
Indian baby," Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban?"
Stewie, Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country.
Indian baby," Yee, would your people really do this?"
Stewie," Oh, try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who will in turn sell them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse the rest of this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other?"
All, [Crying]
Stewie," Oh, hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils."
Peter," Oh, hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas."
Indian baby, But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.
African baby, Don't be stupid! Santa is black!
Indian baby, Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.
Chinese baby," Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian."
Hispanic baby," How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!"
Peter," Come on, Stewie. We're out of here."
Stewie," Dance, puppets! Dance!"
Peter," Lois, we got him. It's all over."
Lois," Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them anymore. They're heading your way!"
Peter," Oh, crap!"
Jack, Hold it right there!
Peter, Or what?
Stewie, Don't shoot! Now shoot!
Lois," So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had to get Stewie back somehow."
Sarah," Well, that's a very long story. But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side."
Peter," Oh, you people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be back, Stewie."
Sarah, Wait!
Jack, Is that a real Prada bag?
Peter," I'd like to propose a toast: to our neighbors! Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey-if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in."
Joe," Hear, hear!"
Cleveland," Hey, where's Quagmire?"
Lois," Yes, if it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived."
Peter, He said he'd distract that social worker.
Sandy Balfour," Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?"
Quagmire," Hey, I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?"
Joe, What the heck happened to that trophy anyway?
Brian, I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved.
All, [Chattering]
Brian, [moaning]
Rod Serling, Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor...
Lois, Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest.
Stewie," Oh! Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! Oh, what I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams]"
Diane Simmons," Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development tonight, as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of the real killer. But first..."
Tom Tucker," It's fall! The time of year when the leaves turn that pretty, purpley-orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade."
Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they're choosing this year's theme.
Tricia Takanawa," Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme is ""Ten Commandments"" star, Charlton Heston."
Charlton Heston, Let my pigeons go!
Tricia Takanawa, He nailed one! We have our theme!
Cleveland," I submitted ""togetherness."" A simple theme. But powerful, nonetheless."
Joe," Come on, ""overcoming adversity""! Let's go, ""overcoming adversity""!"
Quagmire," Show me ""women I gave the clap to""! Oh!"
Charlton Heston," And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: ""The episode of 'Who's the Boss?' where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower."""
Peter, Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering]
Stewie," Oh! Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead...yet. ""Michael Flatley."""
Lois," Peter, it's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric?"
Peter, Esoteric?
Peter," Lois, ""Who's the Boss?"" is not a food."
Brian, Swing and a miss.
Meg," I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!"
Peter," What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her-"
Lois," Peter! Honey, what happened?"
Meg," Well, it was lunchtime and..."
 Canner," Meg, let me tell you about popularity."
 Canner, Bye!
Meg," Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag."
Peter," I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?"
Meg," More like $1,100."
Peter, [Laughing] You wish I loved you that much!
Meg, [Sighs]
Peter," We're never gonna get this float done in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys!"
Joe," Peter, your theme is a dud."
Cleveland," Yeah. I've never even seen ""Who's the Boss?"""
Quagmire, Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00...and home by 11:00. Oh!
Peter," But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. Quagmire, you're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies."
Quagmire," Gemini. Augh! Capricorn. Augh! Well, I know you're not a Virgo! Augh!! Hey, from down here, you look like a Pisces! Augh!!!"
Peter," And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots, I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none of them were half the man you are. And since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure."
Joe," Peter's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in?"
Quagmire," Go, Spooner Street!"
Kevin," My dad always says, ""Measure twice, cut once."""
Kevin, We didn't measure! We didn't measure!
Brian," Amazing, Peter, you've inspired the whole neighborhood to work together."
Peter," You know what's really amazing, Brian? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing."
Meg," Hey, Stewie, if I had a job, I could buy the bag myself."
Stewie, Hmmm. I squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano; I suppose I could as well.
Stewie," All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified."
Richard, Augh! I don't want to play the piano!
Stewie, Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon?
Girl, [Playing bassoon] [Screams]
Flappy," No experience? No, thanks."
Lois, [Sighs]
Waitress, [Whispering]
Flappy," Oh, nuts. Young lady! What's the little guy's name?"
Meg, What do you care?
Flappy," Well, I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job."
Meg, Stewie. My son's name is Stewie.
Stewie, [spits out cookie]
Diane Simmons," Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom?"
Tom Tucker," Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood...and clipped onto this piece of wood is a list of this year's float entries."
Diane Simmons," Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam."
Tom Tucker, And here's our first float.
Diane Simmons," Oh, looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom."
Tom Tucker, Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.
Diane Simmons, Mmm-hmm.
Tom Tucker," This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. Well, that's just plain wrong."
Diane Simmons, Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them-
Tom Tucker," Oh, baby! Look at that!"
Joe," Peter, the float turned out great."
Peter," Yeah, our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire figured out how to get us free cable."
Cleveland, We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax.
Diane Simmons, First place goes to Spooner Street.
All, [Cheering] We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter]
Loretta, Come on now! This is damn foolish!
Peter," My theme, my trophy!"
Quagmire," My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself, Peter! I'm the boss!"
Cleveland," Well, he said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due."
Bonnie," Joe, my feet are starting to swell."
Joe, You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little you have to eat when your legs don't work.
Peter," There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No, no, no, wait a minute, this is crazy. You first."
Brian," Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy."
Peter," Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!"
Lois," Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it."
Cleveland, Here's to togetherness!
Peter, Car. Car! Car!
Flappy," Meg, order up!"
Waitress," Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself."
Stewie, I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
Waitress, Try them. You'll like them.
Stewie," Yes, well, I rather doubt that. I-oh. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you!"
Woman, What a precious little boy.
Meg," Oh, that's my-uh, son."
Woman," Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip."
Meg, $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you have a seat next to my little baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
Stewie, [Belching] Ha!
Peter, [Horrified scream]
Lois," Peter, what is it?"
Cleveland, What's going on out here?
Joe," Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry."
Charlton Heston," That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [moaning]"
Quagmire," What's all the noise, boys? I was just jerk-ed out of a sound sleep."
Cleveland, Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
Quagmire, Maybe it fell.
Peter, Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.
Bonnie, You think one of us stole it?
Peter," I never said the word ""stole."" Looks like someone has a guilty conscience."
Joe, Guilty conscience! Ha! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable.
Bonnie, Oooh.
Cleveland," Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!"
ALL, Oooh.
Quagmire, You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy.
ALL, Oooh.
Loretta," He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the damned time, you could do it yourself, like the law says you should."
ALL, Oooh.
Peter," Oh, it's on now!"
Joe, Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along!
Peter, I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.
Lois, Peter!
Peter, What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Bonnie," Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them."
Lois, I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox.
Quagmire, I don't like the look of her!
Rod Serling, I offer you a recipe. Combine one part small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The Twi-
Peter, Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
Joe," Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this?"
Quagmire, Come back here!
Meg," Well, I'm off to work."
Peter," Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, Lois, and I'm gonna find out who."
Meg, I'm taking Stewie with me again.
Lois," Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick!"
Peter," For crying out loud, we played Pictionary with them!"
Lois, Bastards!
Stewie," Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Hiya!"
Meg," Well, bye."
Lois, And to think they used to be our best friends!
Peter, That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. And that's a lamp. And you have boobies. And I'm gonna find that trophy!
Joe," Well, to be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over."
Peter," Well, we realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy."
Peter," Oh, there's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [forced laughter]"
Peter," Damn, it's not here!"
Peter, Not here either.
Peter, Huh. Nothing.
Lois," Oh, my God! We were robbed!"
Peter, Is anything missing?
Lois," No. I don't think so. Hey, where's that picture of me in my two-piece at the Cape?"
Chris, Should I call the cops?
Peter," No, I'm guessing a cop may have had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war!"
Lois, Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.
Peter," Do you guys have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?"
Clerk, Land mines?
 Lois, Land mines.
Peter, It was land mines.
Peter, Quagmire.
Quagmire, Peter.
Joe, Cleveland.
Cleveland, Joe.
Lois, Bonnie.
Bonnie, Lois.
Quagmire, Cleveland.
Joe, Lois.
Cleveland, Bonnie.
Lois, Quagmire.
Bonnie, Peter.
Loretta, [Clears throat]
Cleveland, Loretta.
Lois," Come on, Peter."
Peter, That ought to slow them down.
Meg," Being a single mother is hard. But the real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. Right, Stewie?"
Stewie," What's that? Oh, yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!"
Meg," This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Well, here's your check. God bless."
Waitress," Here, honey."

Sandy Balfour," Oh, and could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby."
Lois, What are they up to?
Peter," Well, Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day."

Lois, What?
Stewie," For God's sake, feed me!"
Sandy Balfour, Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child!
Lois, How dare you! This is a wonderful home!
Peter," Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!"
Quagmire," Hey, shut up!"
Sandy Balfour," Honey, would you like some pancakes?"
Stewie," Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!"
Lois, Stewie!
Meg," Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new..."
Lois," Oh, Meg, a woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food!"
Meg," Dog food, huh?"
Lois," Meg, is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week?"
Meg, It's easy...when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [laughing nervously]

Jack," Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?"

Peter," I'd like to propose a toast: to our neighbors! Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound, but hey-if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in."
Joe," Hear, hear!"
Cleveland," Hey, where's Quagmire?"
Lois," Yes, if it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived."
Peter, He said he'd distract that social worker.
Sandy Balfour," Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?"
Quagmire," Hey, I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?"
Joe, What the heck happened to that trophy anyway?
Brian, I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved.
All, [Chattering]
Brian, [moaning]
Rod Serling, Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor...
Lois, Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest.
Stewie," Oh! Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! Oh, what I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams]"
Stewie," Oh, Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know! Ah, Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War."""
Lois," Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies."
Stewie," How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Ooh, fuzzy."
Teletubby, [giddy laughter] Tickle.
Stewie," God, the more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!"
Teletubbies, Again! Again!
Stewie," Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Oh, dear God, please once more!"
Peter," Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham."
Stewie," I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless."
 Weed," Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Let's not forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties."
Pawtucket players, [Raucous laughter]
Peter, [Peter giggles] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses.
Peter," Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. You know, when Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Huh, am I right? Who's with me?"
 Weed, This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon: Guillermo.
Man, [Screaming]
 Weed, Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he will be an asset to our company on and off the field.
Weed," Back to work, people."
Peter," Heya, Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation: cute as a button/fat as a cow/radioactive scorpion. Huh? Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair!"
 Weed, I'll consider it.
Peter," He'll consider it! Hey, I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park."
Contestant," Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. ""Go tuck yourself in."""
Pat Sajak, You got it.
Chris," Well, you were close, Dad."
Peter," Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, ""My hairy aunt."" Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice."
Lois, Practice? I thought we were go next door and welcome our new neighbors.
Peter," Oh, no, no, no. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again."
Man," If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it."
Lois," Peter, they might be very nice people."
Peter," ""Very nice people."" Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and bam! Skeleton city!"
Brian, [Panting]
Woman, Pervert!
Brian," Oh, don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands."
 Weed," Okay, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys, time for batting practice. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately, Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor."
Peter," Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch."
Brian," Ha. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity."
Peter," Oh, how hard..."
Peter," Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?"
Peter, Okay. Take your base.
 Weed," Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired!"
Peter," Oh, man. What am I gonna do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model."
Guy, But I don't want to be different.
Peter," What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? Ah, this is gonna drive me nuts!"
Lois, Moving is never easy on a family.
Bonnie," Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever."
Lois," Oh, Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo."
Man," I-17. Oh, darn it. [screams]"
Bonnie," Oh, I haven't played Bingo in years!"
Stewie," Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! Aagh!"
Bonnie, [Chuckles] What a little explorer.
Lois, Yes. He's so full of wonder.
Stewie," Oh, to be the Lindbergh baby right about now."
Bonnie," Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin."
Joe," It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?"
Lois," This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson."
Stewie, You will bow to me.
Meg, Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.
Kevin, I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.
Meg, Will you go out with me?
Kevin, I'd love to.
Chris," Oh, he's gay."
Meg," You wish! Get out of here, you mouth-breather!"
Peter," I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. Ah, great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors."
Brian, I think she wants you to meet them.
Peter," She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem."
Peter," What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference."
Joe, You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
Peter," Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You know, you got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, you know, don't think you always have to bug me."
Joe," [laughs] I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"
Peter," Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Then before you know it, you're using my supermarket, my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Sheesh, can you believe that guy? ""Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"" What an ass."
Brian," So, Peter, did you find a replacement for the team?"
Peter," No. Believe me, I've been looking."
Manager, Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he wishes to know what compensation you offer.
Peter," Uh, me love you long time."
Brian," Gosh, I'd like to help you, Peter. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on the back of my ass for"
Lois," Oh, Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday."
Peter," Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first."
Lois, Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.
Peter, He did?
Peter," Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe."
Joe, Peter!
Peter," Oh, don't get up."
Joe, This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.
Peter," Oh, what? Because of what I said this afternoon. Oh, no, no, no. See I have that disease where stuff just pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?"
Joe," Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver."
Peter, Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want.
Joe," Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?"
Peter, Picture wire? You son of a bitch.
Peter, Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.
Joe, I don't want to impose.
Peter," No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team, like this Saturday. What do you say, neighbor?"
Joe, Sounds fun.
Peter," So much fun it should be illegal like...copyright infringement. [Mickey Mouse voice] See you at the game, Joe."
Pawtucket player," Hey, you want a piece of gum?"
Quahog player," Oh, thanks."
Pawtucket player, Ha-ha! That was joke gum.
Quahog player, What do you mean?
Pawtucket player, Now you're addicted to heroin.
Quahog player, I'm cold.
Lois," Hey, Peter!"
 Weed," It's nice that your family is here, Peter. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them-at home."
Peter," He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. He can hit, he can throw..."
Joe, Peter!
 Weed, What's he doing in a wheelchair?
Peter," Holy crip, he's a crapple!"
 Weed," Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic?"
Peter," Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. Stand and deliver. Get the hell up."
Joe," Ha, ha, you're a hoot, Peter."
Umpire, Play ball!
Joe, Let's do it!
Peter, I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
Joe, I got shortstop.
Bonnie, The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. I tried everything to get the stain out.
Lois, What about lemon juice?
Bonnie, What about club soda?
Stewie, What about shutting the hell up?
Meg, Isn't baseball great? [pause] They say baseball's the national pastime. [longer pause] I can't taste salt.
Peter," Ah, crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! Please don't hit it to Joe!"
Umpire, You're out!
Peter," All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space!"
Bonnie, All right!
Lois, Did you see that?
Bonnie, That's my Joe!
Stewie," What the deuce? Half man, half machine. Why, with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg!"
 Weed," It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders!"
 Weed," All right, Joe! Run!"
Peter," All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!"
 Weed," Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos!"
Player, Let's hear it for Joe!
Peter," Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Yay. Okay. Huh."
Joe," That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket."
Bonnie," Joe, you're so funny."
Joe, They love that one down at the precinct.
Peter," Ah, this sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder."
Joe," Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!"
Brian, Face it. He's the life of the party.
Peter," Ah, yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! Hey! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Huh? Guys?"
Joe, That's my idea.
 Weed," Peter, come here."
Peter," Oh, finally. A little recognition."
 Weed, Joe has the most wonderful idea.
Joe," Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys. You know, to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!"
Peter," Oh, yeah, that's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug."
 Weed," Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink."
Peter," Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat.... No. No. He can't take that away from me."
Stewie, You! How came you by this metal construct? I demand to know who made you!
Lois," Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry."
Joe," That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago, I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen."
Joe," Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas."
The Grinch," You think you have won, you think all is well, but kiss my green ass, I shall see you in hell!"
Joe," Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy."
Stewie," Oh, enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably, I shall take the information from you by force!"
Lois," Well, looks like you have a fan."
Peter, Come on. Let's get out of here.
Joe," Peter, you can't leave."
Peter," Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii, right now. Say aloha, kids."
Meg, What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.
Chris," He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy."
Joe," Well, technically, he was killed by the state, but funny story-he did curse my name just before the injection."
Lois," Peter, what's the matter with you?"
Peter," Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You're not supposed to admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. Jeez, when did it become okay to be handicapped?"
Lois," Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man, and the rest of your family adores him."
Peter," Well, fine, then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. ""Hey, look at me, I'm walking. Ooh, I'm a remarkable man."""
Peter," Well, look who finally came home. Jeez, I thought you were gonna spend all night over at Joe's."
Brian, I could have. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear-forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop.
Peter, I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on.
Brian," Well, it's not too hard to see why. I mean, the guy's a hero; he makes the world a better place."
Peter," Hey, hey, hey, I've done lots of things to help people. Remember that time I sang to the kids down at the Sunday school?"
Brian," Yes, and you forgot the words."
Peter," ? Jesus loves me, he loves me a bunch? ?'Cause he always puts Skippy in my lunch ?"
Brian," No, no, no, it's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger, every day."
Peter," [sighs] You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero...unless I put myself in real danger, too, for my family's sake!"
Brian, Why are the pretty ones always so dumb?
Stewie, [Screaming]
Dispatch radio," We hava a gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead."
Brian," Is it me, or is rap music just getting lazier?"
Peter," No, no. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime."
Dispatch radio, We have a domestic disturbance...
Peter, Boring!
Dispatch radio, Report of a stabbing at...
Peter, Blah blah blah blah blah.
Dispatch radio, All units! All units! A major bank robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous.
Peter, Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
Brian," Uh, over at Joe's."
Peter," Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave!"
Peter, Uh-oh.
Peter," Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
Peter, You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Lois," Peter, what's the big rush?"
Peter," All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal."
Girl," No, don't go."
Peter," I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. 'cause there's a five-year sleepover at the big house, and you're invited."
Peter," Oh, Lois and the kids should be in here to see this."
Brian, Yes. It's going very well.
Meg," Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?"
Chris, Meg loves Kevin.
Meg," Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!"
Lois," Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around."
Meg, Such a mom answer.
Lois," Well, have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer?"
Meg, Creepy.
Lois," Oh, I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys."
Brian," Well, if you want to be a hero, now might be a good time."
Peter," Jeez, Brian, this isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games."
Peter," Sorry, Wonder Woman, I got three kings. Now let's see your pair."
Peter," Haha, all right. Hey, Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her."
Peter," Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan."
Brian," Oh, good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise."
Peter," Oh. Well, actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back."
Peter," Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife. Okay. And where are we?"
Old woman," Guadalajara, Mexico!"
Peter," Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy."
Peter," Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here."
Cop," All right, stand back!"
Peter," Whoa, whoa. Hang on, hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. See, this wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and, well..."
Girl, Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you?
Peter, That's right! How'd you know?
Old woman, We've all been there.
Chris, Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
Lois," Officer, my husband's in there! Can you tell me if he's okay?"
Lois," He's wearing a white, collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses."
Lois," Oh, thank God."
Lois, No!
Peter," Hey, there's my family."
Peter," But...but, I was gonna be a hero."
Bonnie," Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!"
Tom Tucker, A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. [pause] That's right. A hostage situation.
Joe, I gotta go.
Bonnie, I know.
Peter," Uh, excuse me. Shouldn't that be ""whom""?"
Peter, Crap!
Joe, This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out together.
Peter," Aw, jeez, not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible."
Lois," Bonnie, it's Peter."
Bonnie, Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours.
Meg, I can't believe my dad is in there. [pause] This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. [pause] I got a new dress.
Meg, So do you like music?
Kevin," Oh, yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?"
Meg, You first.
Kevin," I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway, because I am not a robot!!! I also like Radiohead."
Joe," And even though society has turned its back on you, I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them."
Peter," Oh, come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait, wait, wait. You can't leave now. I'm supposed to be the hero here. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Dang, stupid robbers"
Stewie," Aha! Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter."
Lois, There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.
Stewie," Augh! One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be..."
Lois," Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove?"
Peter, I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero.
Lois," Peter, Joe is a hero, but he's not our hero. You are."
Peter, Really?
Lois," Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it."
Meg," Yeah, Daddy. And if you hadn't pulled this stunt I never would have learned how to manipulate Kevin."
Chris," And when the kids at school see us on TV, they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, ""That psycho is my dad!"""
Michelle Kwan," And I would never have won the silver in Nagano, if you hadn't driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m."
Peter, I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love.
Old Woman, Help! Someone just stole my purse!
Peter, Who cares? I don't even know you.
Theme Song Lois," That's funny. I don't remember buying Stewie these toys. Oh, my God! It all makes sense now. My baby is some kind of diabolical genius bent on world domination! Stewie: [slow clapping] Bravo, Lois. The last horse finally crosses the finish line. Lois: Stewie! All these months I should've been paying attention to what you've been saying. You're an evil child. Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you? Stewie: Cheer up, Mother. You should be proud. You've given birth to the future emperor of the world. Pity you won't be around to enjoy it. Cheerio! Lois: [Screams] Peter: Lois. Lois! What's the matter? Lois: I just had the strangest dream. Something about Stewie and Cheerios. It's gone. Peter: Well, come on, get up. It's opening day for the Sox. Hey, Chris, Meg, we're going to Fenway! Lois: Peter, you can't pull the kids out of school for a baseball game. Peter: Aw, there's nothing these kids learn in school they can't learn on the street. Gang Member: It's 3:00. Where the hell is Louie? Gang Member 2: Well, you tell me. Louie left his house at 2:15 and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of 5 miles per hour. What time will Louie arrive? Gang Member: Depends if he stops to see his ho. Gang Member 2: That's what we call a variable! Chris: Look what I made for the game. [holds up sign reading John 3:16] Meg: What does that mean, anyway? Brian: <reading from Bible> ""And the Lord said, 'Go, Sox.""' Meg: Dad, don't you have to work today? Peter: It's nothing a little phone call can't take care of. Mr. Weed: Hello? Peter: Mr. Weed? I can't come to work today. I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire family was killed, and I am a vegetable. I'll see you tomorrow. <hangs up> Huh? Huh? Brian: Oh, please, Peter. Your excuses are lamer than FDR's legs. All: [Gasping] Brian: Too soon? Mom: Here it comes, Jeremy! Jeremy: I got it! I got it! Peter: Yes! Yeah! All right! I'm the man! Yeah! Hold on to this, Stewie. It'll be a souvenir of your first major-league game with your dad. Stewie: My God. I shall cherish this forever. I say, Opie, I'll trade you this baseball for your souvenir bat. Boy: Sure! Stewie: What did you learn? Peter: This is great. We haven't done anything together like this since we saw Mike Tyson get beat. [cut to National Spelling Bee] Moderator: The word, again, is ""onomatopoeia."" Mike Tyson: Uh...""C."" Moderator: I'm sorry. That's incorrect. Mike Tyson: Oh, dang! Lois: I'm so glad you talked us all into playing hooky. Peter: Me, too. Hey, maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off and run onto the field. Lois: Peter, I'm not taking my shirt off. Peter: [pulls up Lois' shirt] There. Now they're old news. Lois: Peter! Peter: Go, Sox! [tumbles down steps] [Screaming] Hmmm.[Snorting hot dog] [Snorting mustard] Mr. Weed: Peter? Peter: Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Weed. Mr. Weed: Well, tt seems you've made a full recovery. Peter: Oh, yeah. That plane crash I told you about, it turned out to be gas. Mr. Weed: Aha! Liar! Tomorrow, my office, 9:30. Peter: I'm tired of Mr. Weed treating me like a common doormat. I want him to treat me like one of those deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw. Brian: I don't care for Pottery Barn. Peter, if you want Mr. Weed to respect you, you're gonna have to earn it. Peter: Hmm, ""earn it."" [Snorting drink] Mr. Weed: Why have you forsaken me? Peter: Uh, Mr. Weed? I heard you ran into my identical twin brother at the ball game yesterday. And if you don't buy that, I'm sorry I was at the ball game yesterday. Mr. Weed: Peter, I just received terrible news. This company has been taken over by a conglomerate. After 23 years of faithful service, I've been terminated! Peter: Wow, the business world sure is funny. [cut to ""Dilbert""] Wally: Hey, Dilbert, what do you call it when a guy in middle management moves all the way to upper management? Dilbert: I don't know. What do you call it? Wally: A promotion. Dilbert: Oh, thanks. Here's a memo. Peter: Well ometimes the business world's funny. Executive: And so, on behalf of the El Dorado Cigarette Company I'd like to welcome you to our family. I think you'll be very happy with the changes we've made. Peter: Aw, this is sweet! Why are you putting a window in the middle of the factory? Construction worker: So Aunt Bee has a place to let her pies cool. Aunt Bee: Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry. It'll be ready just in time for lunch. Peter: Wow, these guys sure know how to run a company. Executive: Look how happy those morons are. They'll never realize we're using those toys to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes. All: [Laughing maniacally] Executive: [Whistles] Good boy, Connor. Pull. All: [Laughing maniacally] Chris: Can't we eat? I'm so hungry I could ride a horse. I don't get it. Well, I could ride it to the store, I guess. Lois: I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him. Stewie: Well, perhaps I could help simulate the experience. [throws face into food] [makes ridiculous noises] Peter: Hey, family. Anyone in the mood for lobste-oh, God! One of them has my pupil! [Screaming] Brian: Peter, how the hell can you afford lobster on your salary? Peter: I got a raise. Brian: What? Peter: Yeah. The new owners gave everyone raises. Even Kenneth, the bad-ass mail clerk with the heart of gold. [cut to mail room] Peter: Hi, Kenneth. Hey, did I get any mail? Kenneth: No! But if you come any closer, I'll slice you! Peter: Okay! Okay! Man, what a bad-ass! Man: Yeah? That bad-ass just gave half his paycheck to orphans. Orphans with diseases! [Sentimental instrumental music] Peter: And check out the new toys we're making. Meg: ""Baby Smokes-A-Lot""? Baby Smokes-A-Lot: [smokes][Baby giggling] Tastes like happy. Chris: Cool! That's imitatable! Brian: What the hell? El Dorado Cigarettes? That's who bought your company? Lois: Oh, my God! They're trying to corrupt our children! Brian: Well, what do you expect? Those bastards turned a whole generation of Americans into smokers with their damned subliminal advertising. Ma: Timmy, where's Lassie? Timmy: She's out in the orchard, Ma. Peaches are coming in mighty early this year. Jerry: Smoke! Ma: You know what they say, Timmy. ""Early peaches, long summer."" Jerry: Smoke! Lassie: [Barking] Timmy: What's that, Lassie? Jerry: Are you smoking yet? Lois: Peter, if kids see this doll, they're gonna think smoking's okay. You have to talk to your new bosses first thing in the morning. Peter: Don't you worry, Lois. I'll set them straight. Just like I did with Chris. Chris: Dad, what's the blowhole for? Peter: I'll tell you what it's not for, son. And when I do, you'll understand why I can never go back to Sea World. Peter: Gentlemen, we need to talk. My wife says you're trying to get kids to smoke. Executive: That's just not true. Peter: What about this toy? Executive: Peter, it's just a doll with a cigarette. I mean Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see every 8-year-old driving. They're just fun toys. Jerry: Smoke! Executive: Not now, Jerry. Trust me, Peter. The last thing we want is to get kids to start smoking. Peter: What about that graph on the wall that says: ""The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking""? Executive: That? Oh, that's just something my son made me in art class. Peter: Then what about that poster that says: ""The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking""? Executive: Look, we're a caring company. I mean, would you really be the president of a company that didn't care about kids? Peter: No. But I'm not the president. Executive: Yes, you are, if you want to be. Men: [Agreeing] Peter: Oh, wow. Imagine, me, president. [Joyful instrumental music] [Peter struts around the Oval Office] Peter: I'll do it! [Griffins' kitchen] Peter: [sings ""Hail to the Chief"" off-key] Lois: So how did it go? Peter: I'm not finished yet. [more ""Hail to the Chief""] Aren't you gonna ask me how it went? Lois: Yes! Did you talk to the company executives? Peter: [more ""Hail to the Chief""] Lois: Peter, answer me! Peter: Yeah, I did! They made me president. Meg: Of the whole company? Chris: All right, Dad! Peter: You should've seen the way they were treating me. I never got that kind of respect before. [cut to Peter working as a swim coach] Peter: Great workout, Bobby. Boy: Up yours, sack breath! Peter: That's ""Mister Griffin."" Lois: But, Peter, why would they make you president? Peter: Maybe it's because I can recite all 50 states in a quarter of a second. [Yelps] Lois: Peter, that was just a loud yelping noise. Peter: Jeez, Lois, I thought you'd be proud of me. After all these years, the company thinks I'm worth something. Wait till you see all the perks we're gonna get. Meg: Um, hi. Can I help you? Ugly Girl: Some company hired me to stand next to you so you'd look better by comparison. Meg: That's ridiculous. I don't need... Boy: Meg, did you get less ugly? Meg: Yeah! Peter: Surprise! Lois: Everything looks the same. Peter: Oh, it looks the same, but actually El Dorado Cigarettes has coated the entire inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean. Lois: Oh! Peter: Maybe I shouldn't have had them do the floors. Stewie: I'm ""Nudes on Ice""! Lois: This is so exciting. Your father's first day as president. Peter: Good morning, First Family. Ooh, Lois, what's in this coffee? Lois: Isn't it wonderful? The company sent Martha Stewart to help me with the housework. I take back all the bad things I said about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha. Martha Stewart: A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing. Brian: Well, I think it's a crappy thing! In fact, this is my last cigarette, ever. You make me sick, letting yourselves be bought off with a few lousy perks. Stewie: Oh, I beg to differ. Valet: Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr. Griffin. You have an executive parking space now. Peter: But that looks exactly like my old space. Valet: Yeah, but this one comes with your own company suck-up. Suck-up: Morning, Mr. Griffin. Nice day. Peter: It's a little cloudy. Suck-up: It's absolutely cloudy, one of the worst days I've seen in years. So, good news about the Yankees. Peter: I hate the Yankees. Suck-up: Pack of cheatters, that's what they are. I love your tie. Peter: I hate this tie. Suck-up: It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go. Peter: And I hate myself. Suck-up: I hate you, too. You make me sick, you fat sack of crap. Peter: But I'm the president. Suck-up: The best there is. Peter: But you just said you hated me. Suck-up: But not you, the president, the you who said you hated you who...love, hate, Yankees, clouds...[head explodes] Valet: I'll have that fixed for you tomorrow, sir. Executive: Here's your new digs. Now, get to work, sport. We're counting on you. Peter: Wow. My own office. Well, I guess I'd better get busy. [Pencil sharpening][sighs][sticks finger in pencil sharpener] Ah! [looks furtively around and unzips pants][prolonged screams] [Sinister instrumental music] Executive: Gentlemen, we have a problem. There's an anti-smoking bill before Congress that could put us out of business. Executive 2: Yes. Apparently causing cancer is this year's ""hot button."" Executive: I don't understand it. We've tried everything to get through to these politicians. Harvard lawyers, lobbyists, wisecracking leprechauns. Leprechaun: Excuse me. Do you have a dollar? I'm a little short. [Laughs] Executive 3: Maybe that's the problem. They're all idiots in Washington. Instead of a smart guy, we should send a moron they can relate to. Executives: Yeah. Yeah. Good thought. Executive: But where are we going to find someone within the company who's that stupid? Executive 2: Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too. Executives: Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what we need. Executive 3: Hey, wait a second. Didn't we just make a fat, stupid guy president? Executive: You bet we did. Gentlemen, our new tobacco lobbyist is That Guy! [theme from ""That Girl""] Singers: ? Diamonds, daisies, snowflakes, That Guy ? ? Chestnuts, rainbows, springtime is That Guy ? ? He's tinsel on a tree ? ? He's everything that every guy should be ? ? Sable, popcorn, white wine, That Guy ? ? Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway is That Guy ? ? He's mine alone, but luckily for you ? ? if you find a guy to love ? ? only one guy to love then he'll be That Guy, too ? That Guy! Peter: So, uh, what's this big assignment you got for me, Chairman of the Broad? Executive: [Laughs] ""Chairman of the Broad."" When did you become such a stitch? Peter: Don't you remember? You gave me writers. ""Sir, I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go, 'Whoopee!""' That wasn't funny. I thought you guys said you were Jewish. Writer: He's only half-Jewish. Peter: You're fired. Executive: Here's the thing, Griffin. Some troublemakers in Congress are trying to shut us down. We need someone important, like you, to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what kind of fun-Ioving people the tobacco industry's really made of. Peter: Washington? Ah, sweet. I'm your man. But I gotta warn you-I made enemies on the Hill. [Peter at Senate confirmation hearing] Peter: And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures. Senator: Mr. Griffin, we have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state. How do you respond to that? Peter: Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Howard Stern's penis! Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Baba Booey! Meg: How long will Dad be in Washington? Lois: As long as it takes. He's a very important man now. You know, he's the spokesman for his entire industry. [montage of Peter in cigarette ads] Lois: Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV Guide? Brian: Piss off! Lois: What? Brian: I'm sorry. It just feels like forever since I've had a smoke. I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail! Peter: Hello, Mr. Harrison? Yeah, I see those government guys you were telling me about. I'll show them a good time and bring them around to our side. Excuse me. Al Gore, George W. Bush? Al Gore: Yes? George W. Bush: Yes? Peter: Ah, great. And what's your friend's name? Al Gore: Dick Armey. Peter: [Laughs] No, seriously. What's his name? Al Gore: Dick Armey. Peter: [Laughs] Al Gore: [Laughs] Oh, I just got it. Peter: Hey, Armey. What's your wife's name? ""Vagina Coast Guard""? Nah, I'm kidding, you guys. Hey, get in the car. We're going to a skin bar. All: Great. Yeah. Sounds good. Senator: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I don't know what happened! Peter: Whoa, it's okay, it's okay, Senator. This girl didn't have a family. It'll be like she never existed. Now grab a hold of yourself. All right. Now, listen. You may have killed her when you shoved those dollar bills down her throat. You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. But I'll tell you what didn't kill her. Smoking! Al Gore: You have our support, Griffin. Lois: Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey. And they're both ""Smokin'!"" I loved that in Mask. ""Smokin'!"" ""Smokin'!"" ""Smokin'!"" Brian: Damn it! Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day? But I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face! Meg: Mom! Lois: Honey, your face smells fine. You know he doesn't mean it. It's just the lack of nicotine. Chris: Hey, Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad guys. And he said it through a hole in his throat. Lois: Well, That doesn't make him right. Chris: If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it! Lois: Listen, your father's doing great work, and life's never been better. Stewie: Yes, I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing some initiative. God knows he was years overdue. [Stewie lights a cigarette] Lois: [Gasps] Stewie: You know who I saw at the market today? Patty Croft. Oh, and she has gotten fat! Lois: Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done? I knew smoking was bad, but I still sold my soul. And for what? Martha Stewart? Come on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now! Martha Stewart: [Sighs] Finally. [Farting] [Schoolhouse Rock music] Bill: ? They call me Bill, yes, they call me Bill ? ? And I'm standing here on Capitol... ? [screams] Bob Dole Bob Dole's a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes your style. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole.... Lois: There you are! Peter, I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette company is evil. We can't be a part of this anymore. Peter: Lois, this is the best job I ever had! Hey, since I became president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano. [Laughs] [cut to Alyssa Milano in live action watching Family Guy] Alyssa Milano: What kind of cheap shot...Joel! Joel: I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it. Aide: Mr. Griffin, time for your speech. Lois: But, Peter, what about your son? Peter: So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions. For God's sakes, Lois, he's 1. Cut the umbilical cord! [Applauding] Peter: Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk about smoking. Lois: Please, Peter, do the right thing. Peter: I know a lot of you are already on my side. And for you naysayers, I have two strong words for you: come on! Come on! Congressmen: Okay, sure. All right. Done. Peter: Thank you, ladies and... Stewie: [Stewie coughing] Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck ash! Not ""ass,"" you pervert. Save it for the interns. Peter: Is that a baby? Oh, my God! That's Stewie! Lois was right! Children under 4 shouldn't smoke! Look, I don't care about this stupid job anymore. Cigarettes are bad! Congressman: Mr. Griffin is right! Smoking is a horrible vice! It shortens life expectancy and pollutes our air. And according to recent polls, air is good. Congressman 2: Cigarettes killed my father and raped my mother! [Gasps] Congressman Frank: Gentlemen, I propose we send a message to tobacco companies everywhere by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars! Congressman 3: That's the spirit, Frank! But I think a real number might be more effective. All in favor of fining this evil tobacco giant $100 million, say ""Aye""! Congressmen: Aye! Aye! Executive: But that'll bankrupt us! Peter: Oh, you mean the way you've morally bankrupted America? Congressmen: [Laughing] Peter: Thanks for that zinger, boys. Now, give me a snappy line to go out on. Writer: Actually, our lunch is here. Peter: [Stuttering] Well, that's my mama! [Laughing nervously] [Heroic instrumental music] [cut to the Griffins backstage]"
Chris," Merry Christmas, dude. Don't put it in your nose. It burns like hell."
Cleveland," Merry Christmas, everybody. As president of the Quahog Chamber of Commerce, I'd like to thank the Seniors' Center for decorating our tree."
Senior," Oop, broke my hip!"
Lois," Look, honey. There's the manger for the Christmas pageant. You're gonna make the cutest baby Jesus ever."
Stewie," So, you want to dress me up and trot me about like a circus poodle, hmm? Here, let me consult my agent, Mr. Irving R. Pointy Stick!"
Lois," Oh, Stewie, no sweets before dinner."
Meg," Mom, I'm freezing. Can we go home?"
Lois, In a minute. Would you just look at this beautiful tree? Every year I look up at that star and I think of all of the joy and wonder that Christmas promises. And that miracle that occurred on that silent winter's night.
Peter," Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus! ? Seven maids a-milking, six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk... ?"
Lois," Brian, you're not wearing the sweater I made you."
Brian," Uh, well, it's a little warm in here, you know?"
Lois," ""Don we now our gay apparel"""
Brian, Doesn't get much gayer than this.
Lois," Peter, tomorrow's Christmas Eve and you still haven't gotten us a tree."
Peter," Lois, I told you I'm on dipsaluscious vacation. What part of that don't you understand?"
Lois," Come on, honey. It's the only thing I've asked you to do. Please?"
Peter," Brian, tape this for me."
Brian, Sorry. The VCR hasn't worked since you tried to tape Monday Night Football.
FBI Agent, Do you have the express written consent of ABC Sports and the National Football League?
Peter, Just ABC.
Lois," Well, if you get us a tree, I'll make sure Santa brings you a new VCR. Please?"
Peter," Oh, crap. How come I...commercial! [Chopping tree]"
Meg," Hey, Mom, I got something to add to my Christmas list. A pair of those jeweled bug barrettes. Not costume, real. Maybe you should write that down?"
Lois, Santa got all his shopping done before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.
Chris," I just want peace on Earth. That's better than being selfish like Meg, right? So I should get more than her."
Peter, Here's the tree. Merry Christmas to all and to all shut the hell up.
Lois," Uh-uh-uh, before you sit down, we're due at Joe and Bonnie's for eggnog."
Peter," Lois, can't we tell them that your mother died?"
Lois," Peter, I'm not gonna lie about something like that."
Peter," All right, all right, I'll kill your mother. God, when did Christmas become so complicated?"
Peter," So, uh, you guys know that Rudolph is on, right?"
Lois, Peter!
Bonnie," Thank you for the lovely gingerbread house, Lois."
Joe," Oh, yeah! It's perfect for all the happy, active gingerbread men. Except for the one with no legs! Look at the parents telling their kids not to stare. ""How does his pee-pee work, Mommy?"" Well, I've got news for you, Becky. Not so well!"
Bonnie," Joe, you promised. It's Christmas. Joe had his accident at Christmas time."
Lois, [Nervous laughter]
Carolers," ""Check the balls on Uncle Charlie"""
Peter, Yes! Time to go a-wassailing!
Quagmire," Hey, Peter."
Cleveland, Hi. I'm Prancer.
Lois," Hey, why don't you take Joe along?"
Peter," Yeah, Lois. That'll be about as much fun as a lecture on ontological empiricism."
Lois, What?
Peter, What?
Lois," Honey, he could use some Christmas spirit. For me? Please?"
Peter," All right. But you owe me later, under the mistletoe. Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am."
Lois," Peter, the gifts are hidden in the trunk. Don't forget to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers."
Peter," All right, all right. Hey, somebody give me a beer."
Quagmire, Heads up.
Joe," Yeah, Peter, one of us has to be the designated driver. And I've already had four eggnogs. So I guess you're it."
Peter," That's a good one, Joe. Way to get into the spirit."
Joe," I'm a cop first and a buddy second. So don't think I wouldn't throw your drunk-driving ass in the slammer! All right, let's a-wassail!"
Lois," Stewie, honey, time for bed. You have a big day tomorrow, baby Jesus."
Stewie," Trust me, woman, if I could walk on water, I would stroll you out to the middle of a lake and hold your head under until the bubbles stopped!"
Lois," Someone's being naughty, not nice. You know, Santa's watching you."
Stewie," What the devil do you mean, ""watching""?"
Lois," Well, honey, Santa's making a list and checking it twice."
Meg, He sees you when you're sleeping.
Chris, And he knows when you're awake. I almost caught him last year. But he's magic!
Stewie," Constant surveillance of every child on Earth? Impossible! Unless...hidden cameras. Oh, very clever. Watching to see if I'm naughty, are you? Well, check this twice!"
 Cleveland, ? Rock the boat ?
Cleveland," ? Don't rock the boat, baby ?"
 Cleveland, ? Rock the boat ?
Cleveland, ? Don't tip the boat over ?
 Cleveland, ? Rock the boat ?
Cleveland," ? Don't rock the boat, baby ?"
 Cleveland, ? Rock the boat! ?
Joe, Rock on!
Quagmire," Hey, guys. Check me out! Whoa!"
Joe," [Grunting] [Screaming] Oh, no! I've broken my legs!"
Peter," That's about as funny as Sinbad. Not the comedian, he's hilarious-the sailor. But then again, he was never meant to be funny. Now come on. I gotta go to freakin' Toys for Toddlers."
Cleveland, Sounds like somebody's got a humbug up his butt.
Quagmire," Maybe we should set him up with another lemon snow cone, eh?"
Peter," No, thanks. The last one you gave me didn't taste like lemon at all! It tasted like...oh, you guys are asses!"
Santa, I knew you were awake.
Stewie, You!
Santa," Now, Stewie, you are in my power."
Stewie," No, damn you! Damn you, let me go!"
Santa," Good, Melvin. Nice work, Woodrow. Excellent, Stewie."
Stewie," Aah! It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa. If he were truly omnipotent, he'd have the testicular fortitude to show himself! See? I'm just barking at the dark. No one here but me. [nervously humming] All right, where is it? Where's the wire? Show yourself, Claus!"
Lois," Stewie, go to sleep!"
Stewie," This doesn't involve you, Lois!"
Lois, I don't want to have to come in there.
Stewie, I don't want to have to come in there!
Meg, Sh. Dad's awake.
Peter, Don't bother whispering. I don't have a hangover.
Brian, It's a Christmas miracle!
Peter, Shouldn't you have your sweater on?
Brian, [Groaning]
Lois, [kiss] That's for letting Joe join in your reindeer games. Now you go relax while I make my little Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.
Peter," If I'm sleeping, just stuff 'em in my mouth and rub my throat."
Lois, Just one more thing.
Peter, Lois!
Lois, I need you to take the presents out of the trunk.
Brian, Aren't you gonna do it?
Peter, It's already done. I dropped them all off at Toys for Toddlers last night.
Brian," All? Peter, only one gift was for charity. The rest were for the family."
Peter," No. The rest were ""from"" the family. Weren't they? Oh, crap. Since when did they change the meaning of ""for"" to ""from""?"
Brian, I think they had a meeting about it last night.
Peter, Why wasn't I told?
Brian," They sent you a card. But it said ""For Peter"" on it. So you must've thought it was ""from"" you, so you didn't...you know, it's just easier to call you stupid."
Brian, You're really gonna take back donated gifts on Christmas Eve?
Peter," Yep. Now here's the plan. You'll enter through the air conditioning duct here. Now, there'll be an invisible laser grid three inches above the floor. So you'll have to compress your body to the size of a household sponge and slide underneath like some kind of weird amphibious dolphin."
Brian, Can I buy some pot from you?
Hick mother, What 'choo want?
Hicks, [Hollering]
Peter, So you understand all these gifts were supposed to be for my family. It was just some crazy mix-up.
Hick Mother, Kill 'em.
Hick Father, [Pumps shotgun]
Peter," No, no, no. It's true. You see, that remote control cow was for my son. And those barrettes were for my daughter. And, uh.... Hey, where's my VCR?"
Buck," It's my sex box! And her name is ""Sony."""
Lois, You gave away all the presents?
Peter," Lois, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
Lois," Peter, you brought glad tidings to a family less fortunate than your own."
Peter, You mean you're not mad?
Lois," Well, I am little irritated that I have to do all the shopping again. But at least some good came out of it."
Peter," So I can drink beer and watch TV? 'cause, you know, KISS Saves Santa's on."
Ace Frehley," But, Mrs. Claus, who would kidnap Santa?"
 Claus," Well, Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out."
Gene Simmons, Someone stole Santa? That does not rock!
Paul Stanley," Easy, Gene. Guys, let's go save Christmas. To the KISS Copter!"
KISS, [Cheering]
Lois, You can watch all the TV you want-[kiss]-just as soon as we get back from the mall.
Peter, The mall? On Christmas Eve?
Lois," Peter, I just want this family to have a perfect Christmas. And I need a little help, okay? Brian, my turkey's in the oven. Can you turn it off at 3:00?"
Brian, No problem.
Lois," We'll shop, come home, eat, and then it's off to the pageant to see our little Stewie play baby Jesus."
Stewie," Oh, yes, yes. By all means, turn me into a child star. Perhaps I can move to Cal-i-for-ni-a and wrangle me a three-way with the Olsen twins."
Lois, There's a spot!
Peter," Ah, screw this."
Lois," Okay, Peter. We'll each take half the list to save time. Kids, why don't you take Stewie to see Santa?"
Stewie, Santa?
Stewie," No, it's not possible! Sitting alone in this public setting? No bullet-proof glass? Claus, you make it too easy. Change me! I've leaked through my ski pants and I won't face him wet!"
Announcer, We now return to Bob Hope's Christmas with the Troops.
Bob Hope," It's good to see you Union boys. I would've been here sooner, but Lincoln gave me the wrong ""Gettysburg Address."" How about this having to sit still for 60 seconds to have your picture taken? How 'bout that?"
Peter, Sweet! It's KISS Saves Santa.
Ace Frehley," Hang on, Santa. We're coming."
Santa," Hurry, boys. The eggs are hatching!"
Peter Kriss, What do we do?
Paul Stanley, Wait a second. Everyone knows pterodactyls can't stand the screech of a guitar!
Gene Simmons, It's working!
KISS," Hey, Santa, be careful! Oh, no! Hang on, Santa!"
Peter," Hey, I was watching that! Hey!"
Clerk, It'll be on next Christmas.
Peter, Who the hell knows when that's gonna be?
Brian, Ah! If I was an oven mitt...
Brian," Damn it, Peter!"
Santa," Ho, ho, ho. And what can I bring you this year?"
Stewie," Oh, a peace offering is it? Very well, what say you trim those gin-soaked whiskers and bring me some plutonium?"
Santa," Well, can you be a good boy?"
Stewie," Your inquiry intrigues me. Can any of us be a good boy? Are our primal urges innate, or the result of the choices we make?"
Santa," Okay. Wrap it up, kid."
Stewie," All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium, then your wager is accepted. I will be ""nice."""
Santa, Good boy! Now smile for the camera.
Stewie," Yes, yes. Smile, like a good boy."
Brian, Aaaaaah!
Peter," Aha, Meg's barrettes."
Old Woman," You mean, Julie's barrettes!"
Peter," You still want 'em, you bony old blue hair? Ow, ow! Tittie twister! Ow, hurts!"
Peter," Aha! All the clown fish and yellow tangs in the world can't help you now. That's it? Fish food? That's your ace in the hole? Hahaha! Oh, God! Ow, ow, ow!"
Brian, Turkey!
Brian, [Screaming]
Peter," Oh, Lois, it was horrible. The fish were jumping all over my eyes and in my nose. And on the way out, I think one of them muttered something anti-Semitic."
Lois," We're almost home, honey. Oh, look. There's the star on the town Christmas tree. We're following it home just like the Three Wise Men."
Lois," [Gasping] Oh, my God! Brian, are you okay?"
Chris, I told you we should've left cookies for Santa.
Peter, [Hollering] My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?
Brian, Me? Who the hell buys a novelty fire extinguisher?
Peter, I'll tell you who. Someone who cares enough about physical comedy to put his whole family at serious risk.
Lois," Boys, please. It's Christmas Eve. This is a night for magic, and wonder, and joy. Okay, so a couple of things have gone wrong. But we can still have a great Christmas."
Peter," [Sighing] Aw jeez, kids. You know, I was this close to losing it. But your mom's right."
Lois," Well, sure I am. Meg, honey, get me some paper towels. Let's lose the bad tidings, clean up this mess, and find that holiday cheer."
All, [Muttering in agreement]
Meg, We're out of paper towels.
Lois, No paper towels? [Screaming]
Peter," Hey, I was gonna pick at that."
Lois," Shut your fat mouth! You all think Christmas just happens? You think all this goodwill just falls from the freakin' sky? Well, it doesn't! It falls out of my holly jolly butt! So, you can cook your own damn turkey and wrap your own damn presents! And while you're at it, you can all ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell! [Screaming] [Panting maniacally]"
Meg, Oh. Here's the paper towels.
George Bailey," I-I changed my mind! Clarence, I want to live again! [Screaming]"
Frosty the Snowman," Hey, I guess there's some magic in that old silk hat."
Lois, [snarling]
Frosty the Snowman, Merry Christmas!
Lois, You want some of this! [Mindless cackling]
Frosty the Snowman, Ah! What the hell is her problem?
Frosty the Snowman," Just a second, just a second. Hey, lady, you got something to say to me?"
Lois, Wish? It's easy to wish. But does anyone take responsibility and make it happen? No! You all expect someone else to do it for you like Santy Claus or Mommy!
Frosty the Snowman, [Screaming] What the.... Ah! Take it off! Take it off!
Lois, Must kill star.
Chris," Dad, what happened to Mom? What if she never comes back?"
Peter, I think the bigger question is if this is the way she's gonna act at Christmas do we even want her back?
Stewie, Which is better? Around the waist or off the shoulder? Waist? Shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?
Meg," Stewie, I thought you didn't want to be in the pageant."
Stewie," Oh, Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty of me not to fulfill my obligation to Mother. You know how much the pageant means to her."
Chris, Where do you think she is?
Peter," Well, thank God years ago I planted a homing device in your mother's skull for just such an occasion."
Peter, I forgot. I also put 'em in a bunch of squirrels. This isn't goint to do us any good. May as well see if she's at the pageant.
Lois, You lied to me.
Meg," Oh, my God! There's Mom!"
Peter," Hi, Lois! Hey, do we look like ants down here?"
Lois, Bite me!
Joe," Peter, great time last night. Don't worry. We'll get Lois down."
Sniper," Locked and loaded, sir."
Meg, Wait. You can't shoot my mom!
Joe," Don't worry, kid. It's just a mild sedative. Go!"
Peter," All right, hang on. Look, Lois is only up there because we sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her. Maybe if she sees the pageant it'll bring her around. Give her a chance, eh?"
Brian," Trust him, Joe. This man has seen every Christmas special ever made."
Joe, Are you wearing a girl's sweater?
Brian, Does that really matter right now?
Joe, You got 10 minutes.
Peter," Lights, please."
Peter," As we all know, Christmas is that mystical time of year when the ghost of Jesus rises from the grave to feed on the flesh of the living. So we all sing Christmas carols to lull him back to sleep."
Bob, Outrageous! How dare he say such blasphemy! I've gotta do something!
Man," Bob, there's nothing you can do."
Bob," [Sighing] Well, I guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humor."
Bonnie," I am the Virgin Mary. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Oh, Our Savior has arrived."
Stewie," Good evening. I am playing the role of Jesus. A man once portrayed on the big screen by Jeffrey Hunter. You may remember him as the actor who was replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek. Apparently Mr. Hunter was good enough to die for our sins but not quite up to the task of seducing green women. Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is to spread goodwill towards all men. The irony of course is that this is contrary to our nature. So why do we do it? Because we are being watched! And so we unselfishly think of others, assured that our good behavior will be rewarded with love and plutonium."
Peter," She's not getting it. Okay, boys, take her down."
Peter," Merry Christmas, buddy."
Brian, Wonder what this could be...oh.
Chris, This Christmas rocks!
Meg," Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts. Mom?"
Peter," It's okay, Meg. Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer and enough tranquilizer to bring down a bull elephant. Uh, honey, you got a little something...you got a little...I'll get it."
Stewie," Hungry Hungry Hippos? Claus, you porcine double-crosser! And to think I was nice."
Brian," You got another one, dude."
Stewie," [gasping] Plutonium! He is real! He's really, really real!"
Brian," So, Peter, did you get everything you wanted for Christmas?"
Peter," You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR. And best of all, my own copy of KISS Saves Santa."
Ace Frehley," You just practice that guitar, Santa. Next time we'll let you do a solo."
 Claus, Don't encourage him!
Brian, From all of us at Family Guy...
Meg, ...we wish you Christmas joy.
Chris, May all your wishes now come true...
Stewie, ...for every girl and boy.
Peter, We hope your freakin' holidays are filled with fun and cheer. So have a Merry Christmas and...
Lois, [Incomprehensible mumbling]
 Stewie," I say! It's 4:00. Away with you! Meg: Stewie! Chris: Change it back! Brian: Forget it. Jolly Farm Revue is on. It's the latest indoctrinating pablum for children with not enough to do. Stewie: Hey! Shut up! Mother Maggie: Wakey-wakey, children. Children & Stewie: Good morning, Mother Maggie. Mother Maggie: The sun has risen on another day in Jolly Farm. Let's see what life's rich pageant has in store for us. Stewie: Oh, she has the voice of an angel! Not to mention a balcony you could do Shakespeare from. Mother Maggie: Play your song, Melody Sheep, to aid the little ones' nourishment. But play softly, for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud from his magic tome that holds every book ever written. Pengrove Pig: ""These were difficult times for the children of Ipswich, when the lollipop famine cursed their pleasant village. "" Brian: How can you stand watching this? It's dreck and you know it. Oh, don't have the guts to respond, huh? No intelligent defense of this unmitigated crap? Peter: Commercial! <punches Brian> I'm gonna get some graham crackers. Moderator: Welcome back to KISS Forum, Rhode Island Public Access' most popular show about KISS. Peter: Lois, hurry! It's back on! Lois: Calm down, Peter. You know I wouldn't miss a second of this. Moderator: Okay, let's take a call. You're on KISS Forum. Caller 1: KISS rules! Moderator: Okay, good call. Good call. All right. You're on KISS Forum. Caller 2: Yeah. KISS sucks! Moderator: Whoa! Peter: Trace the call! Trace the call! Caller 2: Yeah, they suck big time, man. They bite ass! Moderator: Wait a sec. I recognize that voice! Is this Dennis De Young, lead singer from Styx? Come clean, man. Caller 2: Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Dennis. Moderator: Dennis, you jealous douche, how about I crank a little 'Detroit Rock City' and play 'Come Sail Away' and we can see how they stack up side by side? Huh? You want that, you high-voiced bastard? We'll be right back, after this. Paul Stanley: Hey! Didn't see you come in. We're getting into shape for our upcoming tour. Gene Simmons: We're playing five big shows in five days. So, if you... Ace Frehley: Rock and roll! Gene Simmons: Why, Why don't you just sit in the corner, huh? Go on. If you're a KISS fan, and you live in the Northeast come out for all five shows of what we're calling ""KISS-Stock."" Peter: Aw, Hell! The Northeast! It's times like this I curse the fact that we live in French Polynesia. Lois: No, Peter, we're in the Northeast. Peter: We are? And KISS is coming to the Northeast. That means...aw. Lois: That means- Peter: No, no, Lois! Don't help me! It means we can do something. Lois: Come on, Peter. You're almost there. <Peter is at the dentist> Peter: We can go to KISS-Stock! Dentist: Owww! Peter: Hey, yo, Lois! Lois: What? Peter: I'm packing for KISS-stock and I can't find my favorite underwear. Lois: You mean the pair with the rip in the right buttcheek from when you stepped on them pulling them up in that airplane bathroom from when you had the trots? Peter: No, the pair with the hole in the left buttcheek from when I held it in for two hours 'cause it was that extra long Palm Sunday church sermon and blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the vestibule after Mass, and it sounded like Louis Armstrong? Lois: Oh, bottom drawer. Mother Maggie: Children, tell Mother Maggie what you want to be when you grow up. Child 1: A scientist. Child 2: A novelist. Child 3: A Cambridge don. Stewie: What's my future coming from these squalid surroundings? Getting into a fight at the Laundromat with some dude who hit on my baby's mama? I should be there, not here! <dreamy music> London. Chris: Hey, Dad? Can me and Meg stay up late every night when you're at KISS-Stock? Peter: You can do whatever you want, son. Just don't eat from the candy tree. Candy Tree: He's right to caution you. I feed on children. Brian: You don't mind watching Stewie for a few days, do you, Brian? Brian: Nah. Ever since Jolly Farm Revue came on, he's been pretty distracted. It'll be a breeze. Lois: Well, 'Bye, everyone. Meg: I can't believe my stupid parents are gonna spend five days following stupid old KISS around. It's painful. Peter: Not half as painful as a tire iron upside your head. Meg: What? Peter: I'll miss you. Brian: Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch? <finds note from Stewie> Stewie: <voiceover> Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live with the children on Jolly Farm. Good-bye forever, Stewie. P.S. I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. Um, I left the receipt on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit but I'm sure if you make a fuss they'll at least give you a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's just, I can't imagine when I would ever wear it , you know? I also left a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'll.... Wait a minute. Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did that sweater have buttons? Well, I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. Again, good-bye forever. P.P.S. You know, it might be a little chilly in London. I'm actually going to take the sweater. Brian: Oh, my God! <Quahog Airport> Stewie: One of these planes must be going to London. British mother: Queue up, children. Spit spot. Here are the tickets, miss. These are all ours. Thank you. Stewie: Spit spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg, Big Ben, Dave Clark Five, Spam and eggs, a baby's arm holding an apple, pip pip, cheerio. [Dramatic instrumental music] <Stewie boards plane, throwing a Nixon victory wave on the way on. Brian rushes through the airport, sneaking aboard the plane through the cargo hold> Flight Attendant: Hot towel? Stewie: Yes, thank you. <drops drawers> Well, come on! <Brian grabs Stewie> Stewie: What the hell are you doing here? Brian: I'm taking you off this plane. Stewie: Think again, Rover. "
Brian, Great. I'm stuck on a trans-Atlantic flight with a petulant runaway. How could this get any worse? 
Andy Rooney," You know what I hate about flying? The peanuts. First of all, you can't get them open. Who are they trying to keep out of these things? Seinfeld: And what's the deal with the razor-blade slot in the bathroom? Are people actually shaving in there? Andy Dick: Hi, Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in the overhead bin here. [Yelling and laughing] Wow, that's wacky! Stewie: There now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Did you sleep at all? Brian: Yeah, a little. "
Stewie," I couldn't sleep a wink-my pillow smelled like farts. But that's all right, because we're in England. Brian: Uh-oh. [Middle Eastern instrumental music]"
 Stewie," Well, I don't get it. Where are England's verdant fields, its rosy-rumped maids, and buck-toothed solicitors? Brian: About 3,000 miles that way. We're in the Middle East. "
Stewie, Where are we going? Brian: I don't know. I'm not exactly familiar with this particular Arabian village. 
 Stewie," Great. Buy one and let's get out of here. Brian: What do you mean, buy one? All I've got is $50. We're gonna have to distract him. Follow my lead. Stewie & Brian: ? You and I are so awfully different ? ? Too awfully different, to ever be pals ? "
Stewie," Do you want to go first? Brian: Yeah, I'll go. ? Your favorite hero is the Marquis de Sade ? "
Stewie," Oh, you're one to talk. ? You get a stiffy from Phylicia Rashad ? Brian: Oh, one time "
Stewie," ? I'm a style flair, just look at my hip hair ? "
Brian," Oh yeah, thats quite a nice 'do there Stewie: Oh, thanks. "
Brian, <Triumph the Insult Comic Dog voice> For me to poop on! Stewie: What? 
Brian," Oh c'mon, you look like Charlie Brown. Stewie: Bite me, Snoopy "
 Brian," ? There's not, a whole lot, that we've got, to agree on ? Brian: 'Cause I love the strings of a classical score. "
Stewie, And I like that singer who looks like a whore. Brian: Ricky Martin? Stewie: Love him. Stewie & Brian: ? We're too different to ever be pals ?? You and I are ? 
Locals, ? Dododo ? Stewie & Brian: ? so awfully different ? 
Locals, ? Dododo ? 
 Brian, ? Too awfully different ? 
Locals, ? Dododo ? 
 Brian, ? to ever be pals ? Locals: ? Dododo dodo dodo doooo dodo ? 
Brian," ? Your head's as massive as a meteorite ? Stewie: Oh, very funny. ? You have a weenie like a christmas tree light ? "
Brian," ? I'd bet money, you'll marry a honey ? ? Whose pretty and funny ? ? And her name will be Ted ? "
Stewie, Oh a gay joke. Brian: I just work with what you give me. 
 Brian," ? You might think we're in sync ? ? But we stink, as a duo ? Brian: ? 'Cause you get a kick out of carnage and guts ? "
Stewie," ? And you get a kick out of stroking your... ? Brian: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't say that on TV "
Stewie, What? Ego? Brian: Never mind. 
 Brian," ? We're too different to ever be pals ? Brian: Oh, man! We're screwed. We're lost in the desert, we have no food, no water, and our camel is dead from exhaustion. Stewie: And I had named him and given him a back-story. Chucky had the biggest hump of the camels in his village. And he was picked on for it. But then there was a terrible drought and Chucky went to the oasis, because he was like that. He drank and drank, and stored enough water in his massive hump to slake the thirst of the entire... "
Brian," Cut the maudlin crap. We're in trouble here. It's already below freezing, and it's getting colder. We're gonna die unless-unless we do something drastic. Stewie: What? Brian: We must slice open our camel's stomach and shelter ourselves in his entrails. Stewie: Eviscerate Chucky? I won't do it! "
Brian," Look, we're gonna die if we don't. Stewie: All right. <Brian slices open camel> Oh, God! It's like Orson Welles' autopsy. "
Brian," All right, just hold your breath and go. What are you doing? Stewie: Wiping my feet. I don't want to track any sand inside. Once you get it in there, you can't get it out. Oh God! I just threw up in his lung! "
Brian," Look, I know it's gross, but when you're desperate and you stare death in the face, you have no choice but to.... There's a Comfort Inn. Stewie: Really? "
Brian," Yeah. Good luck for us, huh? Stewie: You know, once you feng shui the organs, it's kind of cozy. [Loud heavy metal music] Lois: Oh, isn't this exciting? "
Man, Anyone got a light? Thanks. 
Lois," Peter, look, there's Dave and Dottie, the nudists. "
Dave," Well, hey there, Griffins! "
Lois," Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise! Dottie: Don't tell me you're KISS freaks, too? "
Peter, KISS army soldier since 1977. How about you? 
Dave, '76. I don't think anyone knows more about KISS than I do. 
Peter, I'm sorry. What was that? 
Lois, It's not important. 
Peter," Let him answer, Lois!"
 Dave," I said, no one knows more about KISS than I do. "
Dottie," Fellows, please keep it civil. "
Peter," I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice, Dave. "
Dave," Well, throw down, if that's what you want. "
Peter, Name Gene Simmons' special-effects mentor. Dave: Amazo the Magician. What high school did Paul Stanley go to? 
Peter, New York High School of Music. Paul and Gene's band before KISS? 
Dave, Wicked Lester. What year did KISS appear on the Jim Nabor's Halloween special? 
Peter," Trick question. It was Paul Lynde, and it was 1975. Now recite the ad that brought Peter Criss to Paul and Gene's attention."
 Dave," ""Drummer willing to do anything to make it."" Rolling Stone, October, 1972. "
Dave, Exemplary. 
Peter, Rock 'n' roll! 
Brian, How in the hell are we gonna get out of here? 
Stewie, Are you going to finish your red paste? 
Brian, No. 
Stewie, What about your sweet crusty thing?
 Brian," No, you can have it. "
Father," No more balloon for you. I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got here last week. "
Son," But, Father... Father: Go to your palace! "
Brian," Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Stewie: Oh, yes. Just wait until they have to suffer through Jesus Jones. [Makes a disgusted sound] "
Brian," Not that, the balloon! "
Stewie," Oh, yes. The balloon. Let's take it. "
Brian, Wow! I didn't know it really looked like that. 
Stewie," Neither did I. <the landscape below the balloon looks like an actual map> Such lovely printing, too. <at KISS-stock> "
KISS," ?You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'? "
Peter," Oh, Lois, here comes the best part. "
KISS, ?I wanna rock and roll all night...? 
Lois," ""And have a wonderful time"" [Band stops playing] "
Lois," Is that it? Oh, no no. ""And something, something all day"" Right? "
Gene Simmons," Oh, man! I've lost all faith in mankind."
 Paul Stanley, Music is dead to me now. <Simmons and Stanley leave stage> 
Peter Criss," Hey, now's our chance! "
Ace Frehley, Let's do it! <Criss and Frehley sing and dance to 'Chattanooga Choo Choo'> Stewie: I say! Where the hell are we? Cardinal: Pope! Pope! It's time to get up and put on your hat. 
Pope, It's a stupid hat! 
Cardinal, Pope! 
Pope," All right, okay. God! Cardinal: Pope, the floor is not a hamper! "
Pope, Man! Cardinal: Good. Now it's time to go on the balcony and address the people. 
Pope, [Speaking Latin] <the Pope is hit by the balloon and knocked onto a statue below> [Pope screaming] 
Brian," All right, all we've got to do is find the American Embassy and they'll help us get home. Stewie: Home? I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel with that intolerable woman, that fat slob, and that insufferable dog. Oh, you're right here, aren't you? Oh, well, I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm. "
Brian," You really think that, don't you? Stewie: I know it. "
Brian," Okay, we've got three days until Peter and Lois get back from their KISS concerts. Let's go to Jolly Farm. Stewie: Yeah, now you're talking! "
Pope," You make the Pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite them! He's cooking something up. [Train whistle] Stewie: I say! Brian, look. Three rows down. "
Brian, What? Stewie: Is that Tom Bosley? 
Brian, What would Tom Bosley be doing on a train in Switzerland? Stewie: I'm almost certain. Tom! Did he look? 
Brian," I don't know. Stewie: If I yell, you have to watch. Tom Bosley! "
Brian," No, it's not him. Tour Guide: Besides its beautiful historic architecture Munich was the home of many great writers such as Thomas Mann. You will find more on Germany's contribution to the arts in the pamphlets we have provided. "
Brian," Yeah, about your pamphlet. Uh, I'm not seeing anything about German history between 1939 and 1945. There's just a big gap. "
Tour Guide, Everyone was on vacation! On your left is Munich's first city hall erected in 15...
 Brian," Wait, wait. What are you talking about? Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and... Tour Guide: We were invited! Punch was served! Check with Poland!"
 Brian, You can't just ignore those years. Thomas Mann fled to America because of Nazism's stranglehold on Germany. 
Tour Guide, Nope. Nope. He left to manage a Dairy Queen. 
Brian, A Dairy Queen? That's preposterous. Tour Guide: I will hear no more insinuations about the German people! Nothing bad happened! [Yelling in German] <gives Nazi salute>
 Brian," Uh, is that a beer hall? "
Tour Guide," Oh, yes. Munich is renowned for its historic beer halls. "
Lois, Why is everybody glaring at us? 
Peter," Why, Lois? I'll tell you why. Your faux pas last night at the concert was so upsetting I had to call a university professor to tell me what phrase to use to describe it. Professor: Use ""faux pas."" "
Peter," Thanks, professor. Peter: You've been living a lie all these years. You represented yourself as a KISS fan. And why? To make me look foolish!"
 Lois," No. To make you happy. I wanted to share in all aspects of your life, Peter. But I just was never that big a KISS fan. "
Peter," I should've guessed that when you were willing to dress up as Peter Criss. No one wants to be Peter Criss, Lois! Not even Peter Criss! "
Lois, I guess I'm just not as cool as you thought I was. 
Peter, I guess not. <Amsterdam> 
Brian, I'm exhausted. Come on. Let's get a coffee. <enters coffeehouse> The smoke is so acrid. 
Stewie, A man can hardly breathe in here. 
Pot Head," You should get some hash, man. You can't go wrong. "
Stewie," Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly, and everyone in this room will suffer the consequences! "
Pot Head," You are out there, man, in the ether. "
Stewie," I'd love to further pursue our palaver but I am not fluent in ""freak up""! So, I'm just gonna turn back over here, back towards my table. "
Brian," Say, are you hungry? "
Stewie," Well, you know, I wasn't when I came in. But isn't that so funny? I'm getting there. "
Brian, Yeah. Same here. 
Stewie, I think the only reason we die is that... 
Brian," Dude, I know what you're gonna say. And I am so completely... Stewie: Wait, wait, wait! Sh, sh, sh. The only reason we die is because we accept it as an inevitability. Hah. "
Brian, Do you think I'll ever find the right woman?
Stewie," Oh, God! Yes, man! Come on! Dude, you're great! Lois: Peter, are you ever gonna forgive me? "
Peter," Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you, so I will take my rage out on my own body. Let's go to Denny's. <at Denny's> "
Peter," Oh, man! I don't believe it! KISS is here! We don't deserve to be under the same roof with them. Let's go. "
Lois, All right. I guess I could fix us something when we...Chaim? 
Peter," Lois! Do not address KISS unless they address you first! Lois: Oh, my God! Chaim Witz? It is you. "
Gene Simmons," Which one do you want me to sign? Left or right? Lois: No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt. I knew you before you changed your name. "
Gene Simmons," Lois! I don't believe it. It's been ages. Hey, guys, this is the girl I told you about. You know, I knew her before we formed KISS. ""Loose"" Lois! Paul Stanley: Cool! ""Loose"" Lois! "
Peter Kriss, The legend herself. Ace Frehley: My Grand Slam was supposed to be with sausage. 
Lois, I never realized you were Gene Simmons the rock star! 
Gene Simmons," You look great, Lois. Anyone nailing you now? "
Lois," Yes, my husband nails me. This is him, Peter. Peter: You-are-gods! "
Gene Simmons," Yeah, thanks, right. We're recording some tracks in Boston next month. You should come on by. Lois: We'd love that, Chaim... I mean Gene, you big rock star. Bye! Wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy. And he's still nice. "
Peter," Listen, Lois, what I said before...I've never been more wrong in my life. You are the coolest girl in the world! My wife did KISS! "
Lois, And J. Geils. Peter: What? 
Lois, Nothing. 
Stewie," There it is! The BBC! Well, this is it. I'll say good-bye to you now. Brian: Well, have a good life, Stewie. Stewie: Oh, I shall! Oh, hey, I meant to ask you did you find out what the button on my bureau was from? Brian: Oh, yeah. Chris' denim jacket. Stewie: Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him. Okay, then. So, we'll keep in touch? Brian: Sure. Stewie: Well, I have your address. See ya! There's Happy Hill! <crashes into set wall> What the deuce? Pengrove! Pengrove Pig! Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm! Oh, my! The magic tome. But it's cardboard. And there are no words. There are just.... What is it you've drawn here? Pengrove Pig: That's Oswald Owl slamming Mother Maggie in one of them Chinese baskets. <takes off pig head> Dead brill, eh? Stewie: Ah! Mother Maggie! Thank God! Something's terribly wrong. Mother Maggie: Whose stinky brat is this? Stewie: What? That's not your voice. Your voice is lyrical, like the gentle strum of a lute. Mother Maggie: Piss off, you grotty little wanker! Stewie: It's a fake. It's not real. Brian: I thought it'd be best for you to find out on your own, kid. Stewie: I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me! Brian: Hey, come on. You want to get some ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right? You want to get some McDonald's? Do you want to take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes? Okay. Let's go take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes. Meg: Jolly Farm is on, Stewie. Don't you want to watch? Stewie: The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead, Megan. Meet the Stewie who loves funky fruit hats! [Humming tropical music] Meg: Turn it up! Mom and Dad are on! Moderator: We're back with more KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins. They got something really exciting to share. Peter: Yeah. My wife here did KISS. Moderator: Get out of here! Lois: Hand to God. Moderator: Peter! How does that make you feel? Peter: I feel like I've done KISS, too, Donny. And it feels good. Moderator: Lois, you got any tips for the young girls in the audience tonight? Lois: Well, I guess the best advice I can give is that you never know who's gonna grow up to be famous. So, just make yourself available. Moderator: Cool. Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight. Now stay tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum. <dons Cylon helmet> Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum. [Closing Theme music]"
Brian," Hi, I'm Brian Griffin."
Stewie, And I'm Stewart.
Brian,: Many of you have written to the show with suggestions for episodes you'd like to see.
Stewie, They're mostly God-awful.
Brian,": Well, tonight we took your advice and produced three of our favorite suggestions."
Stewie," Favorites? Oh, that's charitable."
Brian, What is that?
Stewie, I got this from 'Dharma and Greg'.
Brian, I'm surprised there's anything left in it.
BOTH, Whoa!
Brian, Enjoy.

Announcer, And now back to The Newlywed Game.
Host," Carol, how did Nick answer the following: the last thing I would ever give my wife is 'blank'?"""
Wife, A little spending money?
Host," I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Nick actually said ""the antidote."""
Wife," Nick, what are you talking about?"
Lois," Oh, Meg, you were right."
Peter," Oh, my God! A genie!"
Genie, I am here to grant you three wishes.
Lois," Peter, three wishes! Oh, this is so exciting!"
Meg, I want a new hat!
Chris, I want a new hat!
Stewie, I want them to have new hats!
Lois," Kids, these are your father's wishes. Go ahead, honey. Get whatever you want."
Peter, That's easy. I wish I could see what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.
Genie, So it shall be.
Regis Philbin," Great show today, Kelly."
Kelly Ripa," Thanks, Reg. You, too."
Regis Philbin," Kelly, Gelman needs us on stage for a couple of re-shoots."
Kelly Ripa," Be right there, Reg. I just have to put on my face."
Lois, My goodness! Did you see the size of that dressing room?
Peter, Yes. They must really want to keep her.
Genie, Your second wish?
Peter, I got just the thing. I wish I had my own theme music.
Genie, Done!
Peter, I don't hear anything.
Genie, Get up. Try it out.
Peter, Sweet.
Peter," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
 Man," Hey, buddy, want to turn that stuff down?"
Peter," Come on, pal. That's classic traveling music. Try to enjoy it."
Peter, ?Riding on a bus? ?Riding on a bus? ?Sitting next to bums? ?There's an open seat? ?Hope that isn't pee?
Man, Yeah! I'm sick of hearing it!
Peter," Look, I'm sorry, buddy. I can't turn it off."
Man," Well, then I'm gonna break every bone in your body."
Peter, I wish I had no bones!
Genie, Done.
Peter, That ought to show you!
Peter," Oh, no. I got to fart. But I don't know which way to lean."
Peter," I know you might be a little concerned about me not having bones and all. But I got to tell you, it's not that bad."
Chris, Dad's just like Silly Putty. Look what I can do to Mary Worth's smug sense of self-satisfaction.
Peter," That's right, son. Take her down a peg."
Lois," Well, I guess we could all adjust to this."
Stewie, Look! I'm making an angel!
Peter," See, Lois? Everything's gonna be fine."
Stewie," Now, smile while I write my name in you."
Peter, Let go!
Peter, [Peter laughing]
Peter, [Peter screaming]
Meg," But, Mom, I've got to use the bathroom now!"
Lois," I'm sorry, but your father gets incredibly filthy rolling around everywhere. (Peter is in the bathtub) (from outside) He just has to take his 12 baths a day."
Chris, I don't like Dad anymore! I invited some friends over to jump on him like a trampoline but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe! And his mom yelled at him when he got home! And he beat me up at school the next day! It's all here in this pamphlet.
Lois," Kids, we just have to learn to accept this. Like one of those stories on Dateline where a family member suffers a horrible accident and becomes a burden on everybody. Sure they pretend to be happy, but they're dead inside. They're dead. And that'll be our lives. Hmmm?"
Peter," What a big, boneless jerk I am! I might have screwed up my life but there's no reason I got to keep screwing up theirs. Good-bye, cruel, bone-filled world!"
Peter, [yelling]
Peter," Oh, so this is where all the waste and sewage winds up."
Director," Cut and print. That's a wrap. Great job, Peter. Coming to the wrap party tonight?"
Peter," Gee, I don't know. I got a standup comedy class I'm taking at The Learning Annex. Actually, I won't be a standup comic, I'll be more like an amorphous-blob comic. I gotta write that one down!"
Director, Nonsense! I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you! See you at 8:00!
Jones," Peter, there's something I've been wanting to say to you all evening."
Peter," What's that, Mrs. Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas?"
Jones, I want to jump your non-bones.
Peter, Jeez! I can't believe I'm your type.
Jones," Well, as you can tell from my husband, I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men."
Michael Douglas, I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Will you sleep with me?
Peter," Yeah, I'm gonna have to pass. But Louie Anderson's eating the decorative soaps in the bathroom. Why don't you try him?"
Doctor,"': Excuse me. Aren't you Peter, the human stunt bag?"
Peter, That all depends on who's asking.
Doctor," I'm a doctor, conducting an experimental procedure to give bones to a jellyfish. I'd like to try it on a human first. Interested?"
Peter, I don't know.
Doctor, Interested?
Peter, Did you just say that?
Doctor, Yes.
Peter, I'll do it!
Doctor," Well, Peter, the operation was a complete success! What are you going to do now?"
Peter, The whole reason I had the operation was so I could go back to my family. But it's been so long. What if they don't love me anymore?
Doctor," Peter, where do you think all those bones came from?"
Lois, Surprise!
Peter," My God! You mean, it's your bones that are inside me?"
Stewie," Well, mostly. We picked up a drifter to fill in the torso."
Lois," Well, like I always say, a family of freaks is better than no family at all!"
Peter, Let's go home. You know what's really weird? This was covered by my HMO.

The Count,Six! Six bats! Seven! Seven bats!
Peter," Hey, is the Count a vampire?"
Brian, What's that?
Peter," Well, he's got those big fangs. Have they ever shown him doing somebody in and then feeding on him?"
Brian, You're asking if they've ever done a Sesame Street in which the Count kills somebody and then sucks their blood for sustenance.
Peter, Yeah.
Brian," No, they've never done that."
Lois, Everybody come quick! There's something in the yard!
Meg, It looks like the back of a tanker truck.
Peter, Wow! What do you think's inside?
Chris, Maybe it's candy!
Lois," Chris, no!"
Peter," Lois, Lois, let him dream."
Meg, What is this stuff?
Brian, It's some kind of nuclear waste.
Stewie," Tell me, does anyone else feel a trifle queasy?"
Stewie," What? Do I have a boogie? I say, it appears my cranium has doubled in size! How delightful! This toxic stew seems to have given me telekinetic abilities."
Chris," Hey, I can make fire!"
Peter," Chris, come here a second. This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, on the count of three. One, two, three."
Stewie, Do it again!
Lois," All right, everyone. Clearly, something very strange has happened here. We each seem to have acquired superpowers from that nuclear waste. We've been given a gift. And whether that gift is Chris' fire conjuring, Stewie's telekinesis, Brian's super-speed..."
Brian, Ask how the Queen of England is.
Lois, How's the Queen...
Brian, She's great.
Lois, Peter's morphing ability...
Peter," Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll."
Lois," ...my super strength, or Meg's super-amazing ability to grow her fingernails..."
Meg, [Sighs]
Lois, ...we have a responsibility to use these powers properly and not to abuse them for personal gain. Understand?
Brian, Yes.
Chris, Yep.
Meg, Yes.
Peter, Got it.
Lois," Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me, would you watch him for a moment?"
Clerk," Sure thing, ma'am. Whoa there, little guy. You got to pay for that."
Stewie, Go suck a railroad spike. I haven't got any money.
Clerk," Well, then I am afraid I am gonna have to take it away from you. [Screaming] Oh, God! Please help me!"
Lois," Move it, you slowpoke! The light's green!"
Man," What does that cloud look like to you, honey? To me it looks like rain! Ha! I used that joke at work. I'm the funniest guy at the office. They say I should do standup."
Lois, This is insane!
Meg," Oh, my God, Dad! *NSYNC is in town. If you can get me a lock of Justin's hair I'll never ask you for shopping money again. Please?"
Peter, We promised Lois we'd use our powers responsibly. But I suppose doing the exact opposite couldn't hurt.
Peter," All right, Meg, wait here. I'll be right back."
Peter, Hi there. Britney Spears. You mind if I go in?
Security Guard," Not at all, Miss Spears."
Peter," Call me Peter. Hey there, fellas."
Justin Timberlake, Britney? What are you doing here?
Peter," Oh, you know, I was just in the neighborhood-I'm gonna steal one of your beers-and figured I'd stop by and say hi. You mind if I have a seat?"
Peter," I am out of shape. Say, Justin, I got a favor to ask you."
Justin Timberlake, What is it?
Peter, I got a hole in my muffler and I need something to plug it with.
Peter, Can I have some of your hair?
Justin Timberlake," Um, I guess so."
Peter," Great. Thanks. All right, hold still now. You'll be fine. Hey, come here. Give me a kiss. [transforms into Gene Shalit] I'm Gene Shalit now! Bye!"
Bartender," Here's your martini, ma'am."
Woman," Thanks. Hey, it's gone!"
Bartender," Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one."
Woman, What the hell is going on here?
Brian, Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something? I got to drive. Did you bring enough breasts for the rest of the class? Ha-ha-ha!
Chris," Hey, Hector, how long have we known each other?"
Hector, Since first grade.
Chris," Yeah, yeah. You remember that time you called me ""Chris Gristle""?"
Hector, I think so.
Chris," Well, burn for it!"
Hector, [Screaming]
Tom Tucker," It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a lower-middle-class Irish family."
Diane Simmons," That's right, Tom. This is one of many public disturbances caused by the Griffin family of Quahog who seem to have acquired superpowers."
Tom Tucker," Very strange story, Diane. Coming up next, can bees think? A new study confirms that, no, they cannot."
Mayor West," Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem!"
Justin Timberlake, You're damn right we do! Peter Griffin stole my hair!
Mayor West," Settle down, Jeffrey!"
Justin Timberlake, Justin.
Mayor West," Mike. Clearly, the Griffin family is out of control. But not to fear. I've tangled with super-beings before. And they can be stopped!"
Peter," You can't stop us, Mayor West! We are all-powerful!"
Mayor West," Clearly, you've let yourselves become drunk with power."
Stewie, Silence!
Chris, We demand obedience!
Meg, Or else!
Man," Is that all you can do? [Meg scrapes him with nails] That kind of hurt! Is that bleeding? I guess it's all right. Ouch, though."
Peter, Anyone who opposes our demands will be destroyed. Our first demand: you will erect a statue in the town square. This statue will depict Blair Warner admitting to Mrs. Garrett that the poem she submitted for her creative-writing class was actually plagiarized from a work by Emily Dickinson. We have spoken!
Mayor West," That's it! We have to fight fire with fire. If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers, it could do the same for me. Citizens, I'm off to the toxic waste dump!"
 Hartman," Mayor West, you have lymphoma."
Mayor West," Oh, my!"
 Hartman, Probably from rolling around in that toxic waste.
Mayor West, I see.
 Hartman, What in God's name were you trying to prove?
Mayor West, I was trying to gain superpowers.
 Hartman," Well, that's just silly."
Mayor West," Silly, yes. Idiotic, yes."
Peter," No, no! That's not what Mrs. Garrett's bosom looked like. It looked more like this. [Peter transforms himself into Mrs' Garrett's cleavage] Notice the sun spots at the top of the right can."
Woman, Excuse me. I have a message from the Quahog Hospital.
Peter," I just feel awful about this, Mayor West."
Lois," Yeah. Me, too. Stewie, fluff his pillows."
Chris, I'll heat up his soup.
Brian, And I'll go to China to see if there's a cure. [leaves and returns with one of those conical straw hats] Nope.
Mayor West," Now, now. The doctor says I'm gonna make a full recovery. The important thing is, you learned your lesson."
Lois, I can't believe we let those superpowers go to our heads.
Stewie, I feel like such a bastard.
Brian," Me, too."
Peter," For now, we are gonna use our powers to help you get better."
Mayor West," Thank you. But as long as I have Mrs. Garrett's giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right."
Peter, Girls! Girls! Girls! [Laughing]
Title card, Li'l Griffins>
Peter," Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club."
ALL, Yeah!
Brian, Because all you need in life is your best pals.
Quagmire, Sure! As long as those pals ain't dames!
Cleveland, O-tay!
Peter, What was that?
Quagmire," Hey, I thought we told you guys to quit snooping around here!"
Tom Tucker," We need to find a story if I'm ever gonna be a big-time reporter, man."
Peter," All right, all right. Make like Siamese twins and split...and then one of you die."
Mayor West, When do we have the grape juice? I came for the grape juice.
Peter," Hey, Quagmire, watch this."
Teacher,"Hey, ""kick me""!"
Teacher," Boys and girls, we have a new student joining us this morning. Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt."
Peter," Just what we need, another girl."
Quagmire, You said it!
Peter," Wow, I'd like to play doctor with her and remove her inflamed appendix before it bursts, causing sepsis."
Quagmire, Gigidy-gigidy-gigidy! [Alfalfa-style cowlick straightens out]
Peter," Hey, Lois, what you reading?"
Lois, 'The Red Badge of Courage.' I sure wish I could meet a brave fellow like the guy in this book.
Peter," I'm a brave guy, Lois."
Quagmire," Oh, yeah? I bet you're not brave enough to laugh at Death!"
Peter, Watch me. Ha-ha-ha!
Death," Oh, thanks! Like I don't have enough trouble fitting in!"
Peter, I bet you're not brave enough to take all your clothes off!
Quagmire, Way ahead of you. Oh!
Peter," Well, I bet you're too chicken to spend a night at the old Selberg place."
Peter," Uh, Cleveland, you mind stepping out of the way?"
Cleveland," Oh, sorry."
Quagmire," Well, I ain't chicken to spend the night there!"
Peter," Well, I ain't neither! And to prove it, I'm going up there tonight!"
Quagmire," See you there, pal!"
Mort Goldman, You can't stay in that house! Old Man Selberg's ghost still haunts it. Not to mention the myriad of bacteria and allergens from years of substandard housekeeping. It does not augur well for you.
Peter," Aw, Zip it, egghead. You with your big words and your small, difficult words."
Lois, Wow. Any boy who would spend the night in that creepy place sure would be the bravest fellow I ever met.
Peter," That Lois is some kind of woman. Quagmire: Yeah. Just thinking about her makes my testicles want to drop. Oops! Speak of the devil. Oop, make that devils."
Joe, All right. Quagmire's team will take the left side of the house. Peter's team will take the right. And whoever's alive in the morning can bury his dead pals.
Cleveland, Do I have a cobweb in my hair? It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.
Cleveland, What was that?
Quagmire, It's just Michael Winslow from Police Academy.
Michael Winslow, [Growling] [Monkey noise] [Helicopter noise] [Elephant noise] [Baaing like a sheep] [Submarine noise]
Joe, This house gives me the creeps.
Brian, Yeah. Let's get out of here.
Peter," Wait, wait, wait. We can't let those guys win. What we ought to do is pretend we're ghosts, see-"
Quagmire, -and then we'll scare the other guys out of the house-
Peter, -then we can say that we spent-
Quagmire, -the-
Peter," -night. Then, everyone will think we're-"
Quagmire, -the-
Peter, -bravest kids in the world. Especially Lois.
Quagmire, All right!
Peter," Hey, I got a great idea! <gets into suit of armor> This'll really scare them. Everybody set?"
Joe, Check!
Brian, Check!
Goldie Hawn, Sock it to me!
Mayor West," If we only had a teacup, this'd be like playing Find the Teacup in the Bed Sheet, like I do with my Aunt Sophia."
Peter," My God! Not only are ghosts real, but their innards are made of children."
Quagmire," Peter, it's us!"
Peter," Say, that's a nice effect."
Quagmire, Yeah. That's really scary.
Peter," Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here and Istanbul is somewhere in this general area then who the hell is that?"
Tom Tucker," Ha-Get used to this sight, Diane. Guys running away from you."
Diane Simmons," Tom, you're so deep in the closet, you're finding Christmas presents."
Peter," All right. Now, remember our story. We tell Lois that we both stayed all night. I caught the ghost with my lasso."
Quagmire," And I punched him so hard, he ran crying all the way back to Hell!"
Peter, She'll have to believe that. It hangs together so perfectly.
Diane Simmons," Our top story today, cowardly kids lay down rubber at the old Selberg place."
Peter, Wait. Turn that up.
Tom Tucker, Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire were seen bolting <gets louder> were seen bolting out of the supposedly haunted house after just one half-hour leaving only their pride and twin trails of urine behind them.
Quagmire, Cheese and crackers! Now Lois'll know everything!
Peter, Not if I can help it!
Tom Tucker, Newsroom.
Peter, Hello. This is Peter Griffin. You'd better stop saying that stuff or we'll watch something else!
Girl," <in Barbara Walters-like voice> Today on The View, cooties, the silent killer."
Peter, Lois? There's something we got to tell you.
Quagmire, Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house. We're not brave.
Lois," Oh, I've decided I don't care about bravery."
Peter and Quagmire, You don't?
Lois, No. I realized what I really like is smarts.
Mort Goldman," Sorry I'm late, darling. I was checking my stool for blood."
Peter and Quagmire, Mort Goldman!
Lois," He's so clever! Show them, Morty!"
Peter, He got us again!
Quagmire, This whole thing just shows that women are nothing but trouble!
Peter, You said it! Let's you and me swear off them for good!
Quagmire, And how!
Peter," I say, Quagmire, it seems to me we've each made another $500 million."
Quagmire, Good thing we swore off women so we wouldn't be distracted and unable to accumulate this vast amount of wealth.
Peter, Yes. You watch the ticker. I'm gonna microwave a bagel and have sex with it.
Quagmire, Butter's in the fridge!
Which actually brings me to my next point, -Your wife's cheating on you.
Joe," Oh, my God!"
Peter," Joe, I am so sorry."
Quagmire, Damn it!
Cleveland, This is ridiculous. Why did y'all drag me here?
Cleveland," Well, I suppose I could give it a try. (Walks over to a woman standing by the bar.) Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back?"
Woman," Sorry, I went burnt sienna and never went back. (A burnt sierra crayon comes up.)"
Crayon," Ready, baby? Who's this clown?"
Lois," Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God. Look at the size of that pimple! You're like a circus freak! ( laughs ) I'm kidding. You're just becoming a man, sweetie."
Peter," Yeah, I remember when I became a man."
Doctor, The operation was a success. What are you going to go by now?
Peter, Peter.
Chris, But I don't want to get rid of my zit. I like him. He's my friend. His name is Doug.
Brian, I just wish I didn't have to look at it.
Chris," Well, we have to look at your anus all day."
Stewie, Thank you!
Meg," Oh, my God! The Bachelorette is coming to Quahog! That's, like, my favorite show ever!"
Brian," Meg, how can you watch that crap? That show's not reality. It's all staged. It's a complete mockery of human relationships."
Chris," You're a good pimple, Doug."
Doug, Feed me!
Chris, ( gasps ) You... talk!
Doug, That's right. And we're gonna raise some hell. All right! Raise some hell!
Cleveland," Peter, I can't do this. I'm too nervous. I gotta go."
Peter," No, no, Cleveland, I'm not going to let you do this. I'll tie you down if I have to."
Cleveland," Peter, this is only making it worse. Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in!"
Peter," It's all right, it's all right, it's okay. It's all right. It's the fabric. It's the fabric. It's your clothes. All right, let's get your clothes off."
Cleveland," Peter! Peter, what's wrong with you? I'm naked."
Peter," Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry. Here, you know what? Look, look. Cleveland. Look. See? See? Now you're not alone. You're not alone, Cleveland."
Cleveland, Let me out of here! I need to get out of here!
Peter," Cleveland, no. No, you're staying. This, this for your own good. This is for your own good."
Brian," Hi. Yeah, listen, I just wanted to apologize for Peter. He was just trying to help out his friend. You see, his wife left him and he's been kind of lonely, confused about what he really wants."
Brian, Brian.
Brian," They are stupid, but I figure I got a few days of free booze and free food before they kick me off. I could use a vacation."
Stewie," Oh, yes, 'cause you've got such a heavy workload around here. Hmm, how you, uh... how you coming on that novel you working on? Hmm? Got a big, uh, big stack of papers there? Got a, got a, got a nice little story you working on there? Your big -big novel you've been working on for three years? ( voice rising in pitch ) Hmm? Got a, got a compelling protagonist, eh? Got a, got an obstacle for him to overcome? Huh? Got a story brewing there? Working on... Working on that for quite some time, huh? Yeah, talking about that three years ago. You've been working on that the whole time? Nice little, uh, narrative-- beginning, middle and end? Some friends become enemies, some enemies become friends? Eh? At the end your main character is richer ( voice still higher in pitch ) for the experience, yeah? Yeah? Yeah, you've got, uh-- no, no. You deserve some time off. I'm super-excited. You think she'll be hot? I bet she'll be hot. I think she'll be hot, too!"
Lois," Peter, I 'm getting a little worried about Chris. All he does lately is sit alone in his room talking to that zit."
Peter," Oh, relax, Lois. What's a zit going to do? Talk to him and tell him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble?"
Doug," Now light it, ring the doorbell, and run like hell!"
Chris," I don't know about this, Doug."
Doug, Just do it! ( doorbell rings )
Joe," Oh, good Lord! Is that. .. Doody!"
Bonnie," I'm doing the dishes, Joe. I'll change you in a minute."
Trevor," I wasn't too nervous. I mean, when I'm nervous I work out and I wasn't working out, so I must not have been nervous. I was... I was very pleased and surprised."
Brian," I really was not expecting an open bar. Top shelf booze, I tell you. And this guy knew his stuff. Made me a mojito. I don't think it's a gay drink. Mo-ji-to."
Quagmire, ( breathlessly ) Giggity... giggity... giggity. ..
Quagmire, Giggity... giggity... giggity. .. (sighing)
Trevor," Dude, put your pants on."
Quagmire ," shut up! Well, I really like all the guys, but some of them seem Sa little too competitive. I uh, I gotta tell ya, I don't know what she would possibly see in Count Chocula. I-I thin k he's just here because he's a minority."
Chris," You were right, Doug! Mischief is fun! We're the best pals since the Snorks."
Brooke, Brian.
Brian, What? Are you serious?
Brooke, I feel like I didn't get to know you at all. Would you accept this rose?
Brian," ( sighing) All right, but I think this whole thing is about as pointless as Peter's cow kite."
Stewie," Ooh, that means this room is mine now. Man, I'm going to party my ass off in here."
Stewie," Yeah, I got it from our cleaning lady's boyfriend. It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna use the money to get a mammogram."
Lois, Chris! Where have you been?
Chris, Doug told me I don't need to listen to you.
Lois," Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it! First thing tomorrow we're going down to Goldman's pharmacy and get some astringent to get rid of that thing."
Doug, What did I tell you? She's trying to drive us apart. We can't let that happen. I am in no mood!
Brian," Oh, come on. You can' t expect me to ride that thing."
Brian, Brooke? What are you doing here?
Brooke," Ooh, I just can't take it anymore. All these guys just coming on to me. I had to sneak off. Oh, could I bum one of those?"
Brian," You know , I don't even know why I agreed to do this show. This is just so not me. I would much rather just be home, listening to my old jazz records."
Brooke," Really? You know , I actually have quite a jazz collection myself."
Brian, Who do you like?
Brooke, DJ Jazzy Jeff.
Brian, Oh.
Brooke, I'm kidding. ( laughing )
Brian," Oh! You got me. You got me, yeah."
Brooke," No, I really like Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster... ooh, and early Coltrane, before he got clean."
Brian,"Yeah, yeah, no junk, no soul."
Brooke," No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase."
Brian," Right, right. You know , I gotta say, I thought she was just some actress looking for her 15 minutes of fame, but she's, uh... she's pretty sharp, you know? I guess you can't judge a Brooke by her cover. ( chuckling ) You can... you can cut that out, right? Oh, and maybe you can cut when I said ""junk"" earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing. Seems like he's probably the kind of guy who might sue. I mean, the guy's gotta have no money left."
Lois," Oh, my God. Peter, d o you think Chris might have done this?"
Peter," Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you were younger. For God' s sake, you used to make plaster molds of celebrity body parts."
Lois," Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry. Very nice, by the way. This one 's going on the shelf right next to Dan Fogelberg."
 ,"Hey, Lois. Am I up next?"
Lois," Just wait in your dressing room. I'll come back for you, Oates. ( door closes ) I'm not coming back for Oates."
Brooke," Glenn, will you accept this rose?"
Quagmire, Really? After I drugged you and tried to have sex with your unconscious body?
Brooke, What?
Quagmire, Yes.
 Peter," Brian! Welcome home, you son of a bitch! So, did you lose? ! You got to tell me all about it. Hey, how was the bachelorette? Was she a dumb bimbo, like you said, but with a big rack? ( laughs ) Come on in and tell me everything. I bet your stories will make me laugh so hard I shoot milk out of my nose."
Brian," Um, Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette. She's, uh, having dinner with us tonight. I went over this with you a few minutes ago."
Peter,(laughing and then shooting milk out of his nose)
Joe,"Peter, Lois, we h ave proof that it was Chris who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy. I knew it. I knew it! I didn't want to believe it, but it's true."
JOE, Do you know what a cavity search is? You made my mom c
 Quagmire," Glenn, would you feed Mittens?"
Quagmire, Mittens has food in his bowl.
 Quagmire, That's old food. (Mittens meowing )
Quagmire," Mittens, shut up. Mittens, shut up!"
 Quagmire, Don't you talk to Mittens that way! Mittens is a member of this family!
Quagmire," Mom, you want this three-way to happen, you're going to have to change your tone."
Brian," My God, you've just made me the happiest dog in the world. I love you, Brooke."
Brooke," I love you too, Brian. All right, that's a wrap. Well, it was great working with you, Brian. Good luck."
Brian, What? What are you talking about? Wh-What about us?
Michael Eisner," Hi , Brian."
Brian, Michael Eisner?
Michael," On behalf of ABC, I'd like to give you this parting gift."
Brian, The bill for the mansion?
Michael," No givesies backsies! ( phone line rings ) Uh, hey, Brooke. It's, uh, it's me again-- Brian. Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last message. Or, uh, any of the other ones. Um, anyway, I'll just leave a quick message, 'cause you might be trying to call me right now and I don't want to tie up the line, so, I guess, um... Uh, I guess, yeah, give me a call. Okay, I'm hanging up. In three, two, one. Okay, call me back. I'll be here. All day. And tonight. Okay, bye. (phone rings) Uh, hey, me again. Thought I might have heard a voice when I was hanging up. Nope? Guess not. Okay, I will talk to you soon. Hello? No, sorry. Hey, babe, just trying you again, listening to our guy Coltrane... you know, okay... Anyway, I got a fax earlier about cheap airfare to Cancun. Didn't know if that was you trying to reach me. Uh, you know, let me give you my home number again, just in case you lost it... Electronic voice: voice mail is full. Damn."
Delivery Man, (doorbell ringing) Package for Brooke Roberts.
Brooke," Oh, that's me, thanks."
Brian," (on new machine) Uh, hey, there. Me again. Your voice mail was full, so I got you this answering machine. So, uh, what's go ing on?! I'm thinking about doing something tonight..."
Brian," Hey, you're home."
Brooke," Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me alone or I am calling the cops."
Brian," ? Brooke, I'm so in love with you... ?"
Doug," Aw! Oh! Aw! Aw! Chris, where the hell are we?"
Chris," I told you, Doug, thi s is the bacon factory. Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit!"
Doug, You traitor!
Doctor," Whoa, that's a doozy. I bet some of those awful kids at school call you zit face. ""No."" Papa Zit? ""No."" Puss Peak? ""No."" Fat ass? Well, yeah. Tsk, tsk. Oh, that's terrible. Well, we're going to have to use some cortisone on that."
Doug," Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game. (gunshot) Don't think I won't do it, man!"
Chris," All right, all right, let's all be cool here... (grunting)"
Doctor," No! Whew! You okay, fat ass?"
Brian," She told me she loved me, on what used to be a hit TV show. God, I can't believe I got sucked in to that phony reality world just like everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking."
Stewie," Oh, I know it hurts now, Brian, but look at the bright side. You have some new material for that novel you've been writing. You know, the novel you've been working on. You know, the one you've been working on for three years? (voice rising in pitch): You know, the novel? Got something new to write about now, you know? Maybe your... maybe your main character gets into a relationship? (voices rises in pitch again) Suffers a little heartbreak? Something like what-what you've been... you've just been through? Draw from real-life experiences? A little heartbreak, you know, work it into the story? Make those characters a little more three dimensional? (very high pitch) A little richer experience for the reader? Make those second hundred pages really keep the reader guessing what's going to happen? Some twists and turns? (squeaking in high falsetto) A little epilogue? Everybody learns the hero's journey isn't always a happy one? (normal voice) Oh, I look forward to reading it."
Lois," Thanks for babysitting, Meg. We'll be back in a couple of hours."
Meg," I don't understand why I have to babysit Stewie. I mean, what's he really gonna do if we leave him by himself?"
Stewie, And now to test my teleportation pods!
Stewie, Oh damn!
Stewie, I'M A MONSTER!
Stewie," So, um...t-this is, uh, awkward, but, uh, h-have we ever actually, you know, met? I mean y-you know I-I don't even know, say, for example, if you have a room up there. You know, a room? I have a room. You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now, you'll probably get a full page in the yearbook. So, um...you know, that's something to think about- (Stewie burps) Oh, I just burped."
Neil," Hi Meg, you busy Saturday night?"
Meg," Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day, and I always give you the same answer: No!"
Meg," God, I don't think I could have been any clearer the last time I turned him down."
Debra," Ray, your mother insulted my steak pizzola again."
Meg," Neil Goldman of Quahog, Rhode Island -- (Shouting) Leave me alone! I hate you! I hate you!"
Debra," Anyway, your mother insulted--"
Ray," (Cutting her off) I don't care anymore, Patty. After nine seasons, I just don't care. Maybe you could try not being a bitch."
Peter," Hey Mort, Lois and I are out on a date night, uh, why don't you give me some condoms? And some Excedrin. My wife's got a headache (moves his hands toward his crotch) THIS big. (laughing) You know? It's like from the commercial. (moves his hands toward his head) This big? Only it's my junk."
Mort," Alright, then. Twelve dollars and forty-three cents."
Peter," Aw, jeez, that's more of a ripoff than that breakfast machine I bought."
Peter," Gah! Ow! Ow, What was the point of all that? Ow, all it does is shoot ya! It doesn't make breakfast at all! Oww!"
Peter," Besides, I forgot my wallet."
Mort," Well, that's ok, I'll just open up a tab."
Peter," Wait a minute, what the hell is a tab? Does that mean I don't gotta pay?"
Mort," Well, not right now but--"
Peter," (cutting Mort off) Aww sweet! Hey, while I'm at it, gimmie all these copies of Marie Claire. Y'know in case I wanna rub out that easy one before I get Lois into bed tonight."
Mort, Kathleen Turner's on page 45.
Peter," (excited) Kathleen Turner, eh, let's see how she looks and- (turns to the right page, not excited anymore) Aww, that's a shame."
TV Announcer," And now back to the Kids' Choice Awards, with host, Paula Poundstone!"
Paula," (pointing into the audience) I choose you, and you, and you. So, come up!"
Paula, (Shouting) I said let's go!
Stewie," (shouting from upstairs) Meg! Meg, I'm hungry! There's a granola bar in the cupboard, I want it!"
Stewie, Hey. Hey! What's this? What's goin' on? Am I talking to myself up there?
Meg," Oh my God, Stewie! (Shouting) Just shut up and go to bed!"
Stewie," Do you know what I do, Meg? I spit in your mouth while you sleep."
Meg," Finally! Look, mom, I've had it! I'm not babysitting anymore! It's Saturday night, I could be out having a life!"
Lois," Meg, if you don't want to babysit anymore, that's fine, but don't you stand there and lie to me."
Peter," Oh Meg, she torched your ass, man! She torched your ass!"
Meg, Why can't you just hire a real babysitter?
Lois," Well, I guess we could do that."
Stewie, Damn! I'm terrible at meeting new people...like the time I was on Blind Date!
Woman," I'm having a great time, Stewie."
Stewie," Me too. So, uh, you ready to go grab some 'za?"
Woman, Uh...yea
Stewie drops the ball in," 3...2...1"""
Stewie," So, uh, wild guess here, but from the looks of your arm hair, I'm guessing you're Italian?"
Peter," Alright, you guys, I got eight crates of Ipecac all on my tab. Now, whoever goes the longest without puking gets the last piece of pie in the fridge."
Peter," Ok, here we go...how's everybody doin?"
Brian," Good, good so far."
Peter," Alright, alright."
Stewie, Nothing yet.
Peter," Cool, cool...You know, I dunno if you guys have had any of that pie already, but that is, uh, that is some tasty stuff. That's from the uh, bake sale that Lois was {suddenly throws up}"
Stewie," OOh, one down. I know somebody who won't be having any {throws up}"
Chris, I'm starting to feel funny.
Brian," Well, I feel fine. I guess I'm {throws up}"
Chris, Oh boy! That means I win! I get to eat {throws up}
Stewie," Oh God, why didn't anybody tell me {throws up}"
Peter," Oh my God, my insides are on {throws up}"
Stewie," No, no please, no more, no more {throws up}"
Chris," Dad, I'm scared. {throws up}"
Brian," Get the phone, call 91-{throws up}"
Peter," Lois! Lois get in here {walks backwards, throws up and hits the wall}"
Brian," OK, ok. I think it's all gone. I think [throws up}"
Stewie," I don't wanna, I don't wanna {throws up}"
Brian," Peter, Peter, I need you to hold my ears {throws up}"
Lois, Who wants chowder?
Peter," What the hell? Hey Meg, you better check this out."
Meg," Oh, God. This is so embarrassing. I can't believe this is happening to me."
Peter," Awww, looks like someone could use a greeting card to cheer 'em up. I put these on my tab. Here, take a ""Far Side"" one. The vulture thinks he's a cowboy! {laughs}"
Meg, {Chuckles} It is kinda funny.
Quagmire," Hey, Peter, you got a card for if you transferred VD to somebody?"
Peter," Uhh, let's see here...uhh...yep. ""Sorry I accidentally gave you VD"""
Quagmire," Aw, all you got is accidental, huh? All right, I'll take it."
Lois," Well, first let me thank you for answering the ad. Now, what do you feel qualifies you to be an effective babysitter for Stewie?"
Stewie," Uh, yea, uh, we couldn't run an ad that said 'No Portuguese', but, um...no Portuguese."
Lois," So, I see here that you've worked for a family for a number of years. Can I call the uh..{squints at the clipboard} Herculoids for a reference?"
Lois," I-I'm sorry, I don't understand."
Lois, The position has been filled.
Lois," The position has been filled, thank you very much, you can go now."
Lois, {Pissed off} LEAVE! NOW!
Lois, I didn't think it was going to be this hard to choose a babysitter.
Stewie," Yes, if only you were this discerning when you picked that happening hairdo."
Girl, Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?
Stewie," My God, I haven't been this exhilarated since Brian took me to see Les Miserables."
Announcer," Attention, ladies and gentlemen, there will be a slight change in the cast tonight."
Brian," Oh, no."
Announcer," For this evening's performance, the role of Jean Valjean will be played by Kirk Cameron."
Stewie," OH! Oh, unbelieveable! Oh my God! How lucky are we, huh? 'Hey Stewie, what are you doing tonight?' 'Oh, nothing, just watching KIRK CAMERON play Jean Valjean!' Oh my God! Curtain up!"
Peter," Hey Mort, do these suppositories come in other flavors?"
Mort," Peter, are you EATING those?"
Peter," {sarcastic} No, I'm shoving them up my butt! Of course I'm eating them! Gimme a carton!"
Mort," Peter, it's the end of the month, and I'm calling your tab! You owe me $34,000!"
Peter," WHAT?! Aww, man, how am I gonna come up with that kinda money?"
Mort," Peter, I'm waiting."
Peter," All right, all right, I got another idea. What if I sold you my daughter?"
Mort, Huh?
Peter," You drop the tab, and your son can have Meg."
Meg, WHAT?!
Peter," Yup, all you gotta do is sign this contract."
Meg," ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!? YOU CAN'T SELL ME, YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH!"
Peter," Woaa! Careful getting this fish off the hook, Mort, she's got some fangs. {laughs}"
Mort," What do you think of that, Neil? Daddy bought you a girlfriend!"
Neil," Excuse me, if anybody's interested, I already have a girlfriend."
Meg, There's no way--wait what?
Girl," You ready to go, honey?"
Neil," You rejected me too many times, Meg. I couldn't wait for you forever. Besides, Cecilia thinks my psoriasis is sexy."
Meg, I can't believe he's over me.
Mort, I can't believe I'm out 34 grand!
Peter," I can't believe it's not butter! {laughing} Stick around, more Family Guy comin' up!"
Lois," Peter, how could you have tried to sell our daughter?"
Peter," Alright, Lois. I don't want this to ruin our date night, so I'll make it up to ya."
Lois," Oh, Peter. {reading the card} ""I'm sorry I tried to sell our daughter""."
Peter," Yeah, you dunno how hard it was to find one of those in English."
Stewie," Ahh, tonight the babysitter comes, Rupert. Lovely LaDonne. Mmm..."
Stewie," {imitating conversation} Oh, hey LaDonne. Hey, what's goin' on? How are you? Yea. Oh, just me, Stewie. Just, uh, bein' myself. Uh...yea..Oh, uh, wha, this here? Just my package. Yea, just, just uh, just uh, my package. God delivered it, I signed for it, the world keeps on spinning. Yea."
LaDonne, Oh no! {laughs}
Stewie," Oh, Jenga, there it is! {laughs} Oh well, I guess that's why they call it Jenga, Mm? {laughs again}"
LaDonne, Stewie! You are so cute I can't even stand it!
Stewie," Oh, thank you. I'm having a good time too. I hope I don't make any social faux pas, like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's dinner party."
Stewie," Hi, Sorry I'm late. I was visiting my aunt in the hospital, she has hep...atitis...Oooo, sorry."
Cecilia, Neil is such an amazing guy. We just make an absolutely perfect couple.
Meg," Y'know, Neil liked me first. And I WAS gonna go out with him when I was ready to settle for him. Get your own spaz!"
Gym teacher," All right, ladies, enough chit-chat. Take it off, get in the shower, and bounce around for me."
Lois," Sweetie, your daddy and I are going to the movies tonight. How would you like LaDonne to babysit?"
Stewie," YES! Oh, I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert. I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley."
Brian," That's what I love about high school girls, I keep gettin' older, they stay the same age {chuckles}, yes they do, yes they do."
Meg, Please go out with me. I'm just trying to make Neil jealous. I promise I'll pay and everything.
GUY," Yeah, uh, that sounds cool, but I'm gonna be in the hospital that night."
LaDonne," Hi, gorgeous man."
Stewie," Oh, you. Must I lock up your tongue with the rest of the silver? {laughs}"
LaDonne," Stewie, this is Jeremy."
Jeremy," Hey, little man. So you're the guy who's been trying to steal my girlfriend."
Stewie," Wha-you...GIRLFRIEND?! Oh, what kind of sick, twisted game are you playing at?"
LaDonne, Stewie sounds a little cranky. I'll put him to bed.
Stewie," HA! I got your hat! Take that, hatless! Now go back to the quad and resume your hackey-sack tourney! I'm not going to lie down for some frat boy bastard with his damn Teva sandals and his Skoal Bandits and his Abercrombie and Fitch long-sleeve, open stitched, crew-neck henley smoking his sticky buds out of a soda can while watching his favorite downloaded Simpson episodes every night! Yes, we all love Mr. Plow - oh, you've got the song memorized, do you? SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE! That is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at one in the morning - the guy who just whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder."
LaDonne," Goodnight, Stewie."
Stewie," If he wants to throw hands, I'll throw hands! I tell you...{LaDonne puts a pacifier in Stewie's mouth}"
Meg," Oh, hey. Neil and Cecilia. I didn't expect to see you here! Meet Jake, my boyfriend!"
Jake, I want some BB's! My dad lets me shoot at cats!
Cecilia," Oh! Hi Meg! Neil and I are celebrating our two-week anniversary! Oh, it seems like only yesterday he was only a stranger videotaping me through the window."
Meg, Big deal. He did that to me 3 years ago. AND he gave me the tapes for Christmas.
Cecilia," He gave me DVDs. The production values were amazing, much better than Kramer vs. Predator."
Kramer, You want him back? You can't just dissapear for three months and suddenly decide you want him back! You can't have him! {swipes a glass of wine into the wall}
Meg," Well, I'm glad Neil's over me anyway. I'm with Jake now. Right, Jake?"
Jake, Maybe someday we'll get married and you can go up on me.
Meg, Neil! I want to be your girlfriend!
Neil, What?
Meg, I was wrong to drive you away. We belong together.
Neil, Of course I'm understandibly skeptical of your newfound affection for me.
Meg, You still got that contract our dads drew up?
Meg, Gimme that!
Cecilia, {talking to Jake} You wanna hook up?
Jake, BUY ME SOMETHING!
Meg, I can't believe we're going out. This is so cool!
Meg," Neil, Neil, n-not so fast."
Neil," {laughs} Uh, Meg, you need to fufill your contractual obligations."
Meg, What are you talking about?
Neil," All right, Meg, according to the contract, every night, you have to put on my pajamas. My mom's record is 12 seconds."
Meg," Neil, I think you're old enough to-"
Neil, {cutting Meg off} GO!
Stewie," Oh, LaDonne, I thought we could watch a DVD together. I picked up the first season of Jiminy Glick, oh, imagine being that guy for a day."
Stewie," {Stewie keeps changing positions on the chair} Colin Farrell! So, I was talking to my wife, Dixie, the other day, and she was saying that you weren't a very good actor. And I agreed with her. Now, now why, now why Colin? Why would we both say that?"
Stewie," All right, that's it! Jeremy must be destroyed!"
Jeremy, Mom?
Jeremy, Dad? Mom? Is anyone there.
Jeremy, Uh...little man? Y-you in here?
Stewie," I say, I think this is how you change a tire, but what would I know? I'm just a baby!"
Stewie," Here's your iPod, so you can listen to The Streaks while you gasp for air!"
Stewie," Oh, The Strokes, right."
Mort," Boy, this was a better aquisition than I thought. We may even be able to put in some sorghum this year."
Stewie," So, uh, anyway, um, hey! I made you a mix tape! I don't have a dual cassette player, so I had to hold the tape recorder up to the radio, so the quality's kinda sucky, but, y'know, all the songs describe my feelings."
LaDonne," I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm just upset. Jeremy stopped calling me."
Stewie," HE WHAT? That blaggard! Oh, come here, let me just, let me just hold you for a while."
LaDonne," Stewie, NO! That is a bad place to touch! No! No no no no no no no."
Stewie, B-But...but I...I...you...I...Waaaaaaaah! [Stewie starts crying]
LaDonne, No more TV!
Stewie," Well, how about no more job? Hmm? You hear that miss fussybritches? I shall see you fired, damn you! I thought we were going to go all the way and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun!"
Hitler," We do everything together, ja?"
Eva, Ja.
Hitler, You got your poison?
Eva, Mmm.
Hitler," Ok, one...two...three."
Hitler, You didn't do it!
Eva, You didn't do it either!
Hitler," Ok, ok, all right, this time we really have to do it. Ok, ready? Ok."
BOTH," One, two..."
EVA, You want me to kill myself and you're not going to! You suck! You suck!
HITLER, You suck!
Brian," Hey Stewie, there's something thunkin' around in the trunk of my car and I can't get in there because somebody busted the lock. You have, uh, any idea what that's about?"
Stewie," Oh? Oh, that, pfft. It's this whole, it's this whole crazy thing."
Lois," Hey, this is not a barn, young lady."
Meg," Ugg, I'm just so exhausted! You know, I thought I'd be happy being with Neil, but I'm not! This is horrible! {starts crying}"
Lois," Oh, sweetheart, we'll figure out some way to get you out of this. Brian, did you find any loopholes in the contract?"
Brian," Nope, it's airtight. The only way out is if Neil commits an infidelity."
Peter," Well, that's it then, we gotta find somebody to seduce Neil."
Lois," Who, me?"
Peter," Well, if not you Lois, than who? Beverly D'Angelo? Cause I don't think she'd do it. And I don't even know how to get a hold of her."
Stewie," Oh, hello, LaDonne. Listen, I certainly hope you'll excuse last night's indescretion, it was just--oh my God, LaDonne! What's that on your neck?"
Stewie," LOIS! Oh thank God you're here, Lois! It was all her friends, they, they were doing marijuana and heroin! (pronounces it ""haro-een"" and marijuana, ""mara-ju-ana"") And they were taking Exema and touching each other!"
Lois," LaDonne, wake up this instant! {kicks LaDonne}"
LaDonne, Wha? I dunno...
Lois, You know what? Don't bother LaDonne! You are fired!
LaDonne," Well, I really don't know how this happened, but I guess this is the last time I get to see you. I'm...I'm gonna miss you, little guy. Oh {reaches into purse, pulls out a tape} this is for you."
Stewie," She...she made me a mix tape?! Oh dear God, what have I done?! I've made a terrible mistake!"
Peter," All right, you all set honey?"
Lois," {from inside the room} Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this. It's so disgusting, but it's for my little girl."
Meg," Dad, how do you know Neil will show up?"
Peter," Don't worry, Meg. I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse."
Neil, Hmm....strange...these conventions usually have Segway parking.
Neil, Hello? Am I too late for the Q and A?
Lois," Yeah, but you're just in time for the T and A. {growls}"
Neil, Mrs. Griffin! What are you--
Lois," Shh, you can call me Mystique."
Neil, Mrs. Griffin! This is wrong!
Peter," Well, well, well. Look at this, Meg. Your boyfriend is violating both your contract and my wife."
Neil," Meg! I wasn't doing anything! Mrs. Griffin was just-- OWW, you're bending it."
Meg, I don't care. You've nullified the contract. I'm free! {laughs}
Neil," Free? I don't understand, Meg. You don't want to be my girlfriend?"
Meg," Well, I thought I did, but I guess I was just jealous."
Neil," I see. Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you WANT to be with me, not because you have to."
Meg," Thank you, Neil."
Neil," Cecilia? It's The Gold-man. How 'bout we fire up the ol' Segway and find a nice, quiet field to do long division in? I-I mean 'a nice, quiet field in which to do long division', sorry. {holds hand up to the phone} Sorry, everybody. {back to talking on the phone} Ok, I'm on my way."
Meg, He's going back to Cecilia? I can't believe I'm actually jealous.
Lois, I can't believe I actually touched him.
Peter," I still can't believe it's not butter! {laughs} Next week, I run for mayor of Quahog. Do I have what it takes? We'll find out, don't miss it."
Meg," Well, here we are again. Another Saturday night with basic cable."
Stewie," Yep. {sigh} I suppose none of us are really cut out for love, and we--OH MY GOD! JEREMY'S STILL IN THE TRUNK! Oh God, how long's it been? Uh...let's see...two weeks, yep. Yep, he's dead. Definitely dead."
s like I tell the other volunteers down at the adoption center," My God, you know, if I could just take all the orphans in the world... and just, you know, buy a farm somewhere... and let them all run free, you know."
 Just as I thought," France, art... murder?"
A little hint, all the answers have to do with something here at the school.
Peter," You know what grinds my gears? This Lindsay Lohan. You just get up there half-naked and what? Jiggling them little things about. What do you want? What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want! I'll tell you what you want: nothing! You want nothing that's what you want. And that's ""What grinds my gears."""
Lois, Us women can be stupid sometimes. That's why I went back to men.
Meg," oh... okay, mom... See you later. [walks out]"
Chris, [moves closer to Lois] Go on...
Diane," And now, neglectful father and Quahog's newest social pariah, Peter Griffin, with another segment of ""Grind My Gears"". Peter?"
Peter," Thank you, Diane. You know what really grinds my gears? People in the nineteenth century. Why don't they get with the freakin' program? It's called an automobile, folks. It's much faster than a horse! Oh. Well, it appears I've been fired. Well, as long as I’m no longer working here, let me tell you something; you know what really grinds my gears? You, America. FUCK you!"
Brian," So, is it just pool water that turns you into a sniveling girl, or all water?"
Stewie," Mom! Brian just asked me if it's just pool water that turns me into a sniveling girl, or all water!"
Peter," You know, that really grinds my gears. Where in the bible does it say that a man can't fire off some knuckle-children in the privacy of his own neighbor's living room while his neighbor's at work because I don't have a DVD player? Well, I don't know where it says it because the Bible was way too long to read!"
Stewie," Hell? Well, that's a bit much, don't you think? Sure I've devoted my life to killing my mother, but who hasn't? You know for Hell, this isn't really that bad."
Diane Simmons," Now, let's go to Ollie Williams with the Adopt-a-Pet of the week."
Ollie Williams, Who wants this dog!?
Diane Simmons," Thanks, Ollie. And now, let's go to Peter Griffin with ""Ya Know What Really Grinds My..."""
Diane Simmons," Tom, what are you doing? You don't work here anymore."
Tom Tucker," Well, Diane, I have an exclusive story. And I can't figure out how to check my e-mail from home."
Ollie Williams, Did you check your TCP/IP settings!?
Tom Tucker," Yes I did, Ollie."
Ollie Williams, Enable cookies!?
Tom Tucker," Yes, Ollie."
Ollie Williams, You want this dog!?
Tom Tucker," No, thank you, Ollie."
Lois," Come on, Stewie, there's no need to be afraid, it won't bite you."
Stewie," Shut up! Stupid! What a stupid thing to say! You drown in it, you moron! It doesn't have to bite you!"
Peter," You know what really grinds my gears? Nobody's come up with a new priest and a rabbi joke in like thirty years. You know? I mean, okay, ah, umm. Priest and a rabbi go, go onto the supermarket, and, uh, the priest wants to buy a ham. And the rabbi says, ""Ah, I can't eat it. It's forbidden."" Couldn't eat it. Not allowed, pigs are like superheroes to them. Is it perfect? No, but I, I don't see you coming up with anything. And that, people, is what grinds my gears."
Stewie," [after Brian walks in on Stewie shaving himself] Umm, you know, feel free to say no to this, but... would you shave my coin purse?"
Peter," Hey, Stewie. How about Daddy teaches you how to swim?"
Stewie, Go... away... fat man. [Peter picks up Stewie] Dah! What do you think you're doing? No means no!
Peter," Come on, Stewie! In... the... pool!"
Stewie," No! No, I don't want to die! I want to live! Live!"
Peter Griffin, Another thing that grinds my gears is when I can't find the droids I'm looking for.
Stormtrooper," Yeah, me too. What gives with that?"
Stewie," Look, I really don't want to go to hell, but I can't stop my nature. I'm just a hateful person."
Brian, You're not hateful you just need to control your anger. Like I do.
Stewie," Oh, you mean by being sauced all day! Wait a minute! Of Course! That's it! If I'm drunk I'll be calm and if I'm calm I'll be nice, and if I'm nice, then I won't go to hell. Fix me a highball I'm going to get good and tight!"
Gandhi," [doing stand-up comedy] And Americans are all like, ""Hey, bitch!"" and the Indian people, we do not call our women in such a way."
Tom Tucker," Pay attention to me! I'm trying to ruined you! You want to see me, sir?"
Stewie," OK, now, if I get a fax, can I stay online and still receive the fax without a dedicated line?"
Foreign Employee," Yeah, you can put a piece of paper in here and make, like, a phone call, and your friend will get another piece of paper with the same picture."
Stewie, ...Can I possibly speak to someone who didn't come to this country on a floating door?
Lois," Kids, can we have some privacy please?"
Peter," Yeah, you guys are more annoying than that announcer on those TV commercials."
Al Harrington," Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man! Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man! Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man!

Peter," Before you know it, Meg will be beating guys off with two hands!"
Stewie," Forgive me, Mr. Oinkbaum, you will be missed. [hits piggy bank with a hammer] There we are."
Brian, What are you doing?
Stewie," None of your beeswax, Ramona. But if you must know, I need a plane ticket to San Francisco."
Brian," Pfah! Good luck, plane tickets are about 450 bucks."
Stewie," Four hundred... Brian, hit me in the mouth."
Brian, What? Why?
Stewie, I hear this Tooth Fairy gives you money for your teeth. Have at it!
Brian," Uh, OK. [goes to take a swing at Stewie]"
Stewie," NO, NO, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, STOP, STOP! [Brian lowers his fist] Why did you stop? I said hit me!"
Brian, You flinched.
Stewie," Well, of course I flinched, you were going to hit me!"
Brian, Well make up your mind! What do you want me to do?
Stewie," Hit me! [Brian tries again] ARGH! No, no! Don't! Don't! [Brian sighs] I'm sorry, look, I know I'm being hard to read- OOF!"
Stewie," Oh, there you are. I thought you should- What are you doing?"
Brian, Paying bills.
Stewie, What bills? You have bills?
Brian," Well, there's cable and-"
Stewie, Peter pays for the cable!
Brian," It's at this, uh...It's at this girl's house. Do you want something?"
Stewie, Yes. I'm still short for my trip. I've only got $200. I suggest you pony up the difference immediately or I'll e-mail the contents of your hard drive to the F.B.I.!
Brian," What are you talking about? There's nothing on there. [Stewie shows him a nude picture of himself on Brian's computer] Stewie, why is it so hard to accept that Peter's your real father?"
Stewie, Because he's an idiot. You remember that time he went to The Today Show?.
Katie Couric, Coming up on Today. Tom Cruise has a new movie. We're gonna be talking to him.
Peter, [knocking on glass] Katie.
Katie Couric, Funnyman Al Franken will be stopping by for a visit.
Peter, [knocking on glass] Katie!
Katie Couric, And Wolfgang Puck shares his recipe for apple strudel.
Peter, [knocking on glass] Katie!
Katie Couric, So stay tuned because we've got all this and more coming up in the next hour.
Peter, [breaks through glass and yells..] Katie!
Katie Couric, WHAT!?
Peter," Oh, well, never mind."
Quagmire," Hey, Brian, what do you think of my sign?"
Brian," Quagmire's Cross Country Tour. Uh, Isn't there an 'O' in Country?"
Quagmire," No. Look out, California, here I come! He he he!"
Stewie, California! [takes his tryke and throws it in the Winnebago]
Brian, What are you doing?
Stewie," Well, you heard Captain Syphilis, we're going to California!"
Stewie," Oh, they won't even know we're gone. [pulls a pad out from his pocket and pushes a button. A robot Stewie and a robot Brian come out of Stewie's closet]"
Robot Stewie," Damn you, vile woman. Blast. What the deuce?"
Robot Brian, I am a tool. Stewie is much better than me at everything including arts and crafts and the guitar. I have no friends.
Quagmire, Glad you guys are joinin' me.
Stewie," Hey, did you guys see Three Men and a Baby?"
Brian, Yeah.
Stewie, Did you know there's a ghost in there behind the window?
Brian, That's an urban legend. It's just a piece of cardboard.
Stewie," No, it's a ghost. I heard."
Brian, You heard from who?
Stewie," From, um...uh...Lois?"
Brian," Yeah, right."
Stewie, Cleveland?
Brian, No.
Stewie, Death?
Brian, No.
Stewie, Greased Up Deaf Guy?
Brian, He said that?
Brian, What are you doing?
Stewie, Your knight was at king's rook six.
Brian," No, my bishop was at king's rook six. My knight was at queen five."
Stewie," No, no, no."
Brian, Yes. Yes. I was sitting right- I saw right-
Stewie, No. In your dreams your knight was at queen five. Yeah...
Stewie, Oh! Look at that! Look at that! Now your knight is at refrigerator five.
Brian, That's real mature.
Stewie," Yeah, well, who comes out a winner? Me. [imitates audience cheering] Griffin once again. Undefeated champion of the world!"
Brian, Are you alright?
Stewie, NEVER BETTER! I GOT SOME PEP PILLS FROM A TRUCKER AT THE LAST STOP! KEEPS ME AWAKE!
Brian,You took pills?
Stewie," WEST COAST TURNAROUNDS! TRUCKER SAID TO ONLY TAKE ONE, BUT I TOOK ALL OF THEM!"
Brian," Look, maybe you should slow down..."
Stewie, WHY? WE'RE MAKING GOOD TIME!
Brian, We're not even on the road.
Stewie, HUH?
Brian, I said we're not even on the road!
Stewie," DON'T NEED TO BE! COMPASS SAYS WEST, THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED!"
Brian," Stewie, we're in the middle of the desert."
Stewie," I KNOW! IMAGINE THE NADS ON THOSE GUYS WHO DID THIS IN A WAGON! PIONEERS, BRIAN! WE SHARE THEIR SPIRIT! MANIFEST DESTINY!"
Brian," OK, that's it, give me the wheel!"
Stewie, GO TO HELL!
Stewie," Oh my god, Brian! Do you see what I see?"
Brian, A Dr. Pepper machine!
Stewie," Yes! I can taste it now! [The two rush to the machine laughing, then get there and their faces fall]"
Brian," Dammit, it was a mirage."
Stewie," Ugh, an RC Cola machine..."
Wilford Brimley," Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley and I have diabetes. It hurts me to pee and it causes me to be short with my family. I can't sleep at night. The other day I stubbed my toe and took it out on the dog. And two weeks ago I ran out of vanilla ice cream and struck my wife. Then I find out my wife has been dead for six years. Who the hell did I hit?"
Lois," Chris, I'm gonna teach you to be an affable, desirable young man who doesn't smell like the inside of a wool hat."
Chris, Why you gotta break balls?
Cheetara," Hey, Lion-O, what's going on?"
O," I'm not sure, Cheetara. But, I've gotta bad feeling Mumm-Ra is up to something."
Cheetara, Hmm. I'll be right back. I'll be right back I'm gonna use the john.
O, Eye of Thundera give me sight beyond sight.
Snarf," Lion-O, what are you doing? Snarf, snarf."
O," Oh, hey, uh. Not much, not much. You wanna do uh, get wasted or something?"
Stewie," Smells like Head and Shoulders, but you don't have dandruff."
Stu, Exactly!
Stewie, Aah!
Stewie," [to Stu] I could handle the crappy apartment and the pedestrian job, but now you're telling me I'm a 35-year old Parade magazine reading virgin?!"
Stewie, [whispering to Stu] You listen to me Stewart Griffin! You march in there right now and [looks into a book] insert your penis into her vagina!
s boss at work," Hey, Stew! I heard about what you did with Fran last night. Y'know, Interoffice sex is prohibited, regardless how hilariously brief and unsatisfying it was. You're fired."
Stu, Can I still read Parade?
Stewie," NO, YOU STILL CAN'T READ PARADE!"
Stu, We'll have to borrow the money from Mommy and Daddy. [Stewie leaps onto Stew's head and peels back his eyelids] AH!
Stewie, Never call them that again! It's Lois and the Fatman! Do you hear me?
Stu," Yes, yes!"
Vanessa," Ah, screw him! That fuckin' kid's from Guam. Probably only speaks Spanish or some shit."
Stewie," Let me tell you something, Nessa, a bullet sounds the same in every language. So stick a fucking sock in it, you cow."
Old Lois," Hi, Glenn. How's your arthritis?"
Old Quagmire," Good, but since you walked in here I'm feeling a little stiff. Giggity Gig...oh, I just pooped a little."
Old Cleveland in a slow voice, Oh... that's... nas... ty.
We now return to, Freddy got fingered.

Peter Griffin," Ah, see, that's an even more beautiful sight than 72 virgins waiting in Heaven for a suicide bomber!"
Suicide Bomber, [gleefully] Here I am! [looks shocked to see a bunch of male happy sci-fi geeks in costumes playing on computers]
Nerd in Wizard Costume," [looks up, smiling] We're playing ""Magic: The Gathering""! Wanna join?"
Suicide Bomber, [angrily yells at sky] OSAMA!!!!
Peter Griffin," [furious] We don't know him! In fact, he could possibly not even be a real boy! He could be just two crafty dwarves in an overcoat, wanting to see what sex with a big person's like! Is that what you want, Lois?! Two crafty dwarves in an overcoat gettin' in bed with your only daughter... Wait, do dwarves grant wishes?"
Lois Griffin," No, Peter. They're ordinary people, just like you and me."
Peter Griffin," Well, goodbye phone in the bathroom, but still, Lois, its the same point I'm trying to make!"
 Hartman," Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter. [bursts out laughing] I mean, I mean... I mean your daughter's in a coma! What-- oh my God, did, did you hear what I said?! [babbles] Brain freeze! [laughs] Oh, my God! Oh, that one is going in the Christmas letter!"
Peter Griffin," I never realized how much I've taken her for granted. I mean, she's my only daughter, and I feel like I never treated her as well as I should have."
Peter Griffin," Hey, Meg, you got something on your shirt. [points to her shirt. She looks down, and he flicks her nose and laughs."
Meg Griffin," Hi, Dad. [Peter quickly pulls out a gun and shoots her; she falls over, bleeding]"
Lois Griffin," Oh, don't be too hard on yourself, Peter. We all do things that we're not proud of."
Peter Griffin," Well, I am gonna change! You hear me, Meg? If you come out of this, I am gonna treat you like a princess for the rest of your life. 'Cause I've been a worse father than Abraham."
Isaac, You wanna tell me what the fuck THAT was!?
Stewie," Hey, Brian. Knock-knock."
Brian, Who's there?
Stewie, [whispering] Two friends building a house together.
Meg Griffin," Yeah, and I can't believe how you stood up to Connie D'Amico for me."
Amico," Hey, Meg."
Meg Griffin," Uh, hi, Connie."
Amico, I can't fit all my books in my locker. Could I put the rest of them on your ginormous ass? [she and her friends laugh. Peter walks in]
Peter Griffin," Hey, Connie. Hi, Peter Griffin. Meg's father. Say, uh, can you do me a favor? Uh, you see that fire extinguisher there? [Peter starts smashing her head in it repeatedly]"
Meg Griffin," Dad, that's enough! [tries to pull him away] Dad, that's enough! THAT'S ENOUGH, DAD!"
 Stoneberg," So, why exactly do you want this separation?"
Fred Flintstone," Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell, the cat put me outside. I was banging on the door for like, twenty minutes shouting, ""Wilma!"""
Wilma Flintstone, I didn't hear you.
Fred Flintstone," Oh, there's no way you didn't hear me."
Wilma Flintstone, I was in the shower.
Fred Flintstone," Oh, she was in the shower."
Wilma Flintstone," [overlapping with Fred] The elephant's trunk was on full blast; I couldn't hear you. And besides, you're always yelling about something! How the hell am I supposed to know when to pay attention?!"
Fred Flintstone," [overlapping with Wilma] You could have been right on the other side of the door, and you wouldn't have done a damn thing! All you do is spend my money on expensive clothes and hair-dos! [wilma stops] But when I wanna get my rocks off, you're nowhere to be found, you passive-agressive bitch!"
Peter, I just want to talk to him.
Meg, Why do you have a shotgun?
Peter, I just want to talk to him.
Meg," Dad, this is ridiculous!"
Peter, I just want to talk to him.
Meg, Put that gun away!
Peter, I just want to talk to him.
Meg," What are you doing, it's not his fault."
Peter, I just want to shoot him.
Lois Griffin," Look, Why don't you just talk to him? You might find out he's not so bad."
Peter Griffin," Alright, Lois, but I know what my gut tells me. [turns and faces the camera] And right now, it's telling me I have... [the word ""Indigestion"" appears over his stomach, which swells]"
Deep Voice, INDIGESTION!
Peter Griffin," But, I'll suck it up and talk to Michael. [turns his backside to the camera] Even though I've also got... [the word ""Diarrhea"" appears on his butt, which also swells]"
Deep Voice, DIARRHEA!
Michael," Uh, Meg, I'm not sure, but I think your dad is sitting at that table over there."
Meg Griffin, What? Where?
Michael," Well, I can't tell if it's him. I, I think he's wearing some kind of disguise. [camera pans to the right to reveal Peter sitting at another table, dressed in a stereotypical Asian man disguise]"
Meg Griffin," Oh my God, Dad! [she and Michael walk up to him] What do you think you're doing?"
Meg Griffin," [annoyed] I didn't say ""Peter"". I said ""Dad""!"
Peter Griffin, [has a slow look of realization on his face; still in fake Asian accent] Ohhhhhhhhh...
Stewie," All right, Brian, I'm gonna go up to the upper level and run this wire down through the wall. Grab your walkie; I'll call you when I get up there."
Brian, Okay. [Stewie leaves with the wire and a walkie-talkie]
Stewie," Brian, pick up. Over."
Brian, What?
Stewie," Brian, please say ""over"" when you finish talking. Over."
Brian, What? Over.
Stewie, Do you see the wire yet? Over.
Brian, No.
Stewie, No... what? Over.
Brian, No. Over.
Stewie," Okay, I'm gonna start feeding it through. Over."
Brian," Wait, if you haven't started feeding it, why'd you ask me if I could see it?"
Stewie, Didn't copy that. Over.
Brian," I said, why'd you ask me if I could see it if you haven't started feeding it? Over."
Stewie," Oh, that's better, I can hear you now. Over. You see it yet? Over."
Brian," You know, you're a jackass. For the record, I don't wanna hang out with you anymore when this is over."
Stewie," When this is what, Brian? Over."
Brian," I said, I don't wanna hang out with you anymore when this is over."
Stewie, When this is what? You gotta finish your sentence. Over.
Brian, That's it. My sentence is over.
Stewie," Your sentence is what, Brian? Over."
Brian," My sentence is... Wait a minute, I have to say ""over"" even if the sentence ends with the word ""over""?"
Stewie," Ends with the word what, Brian? Over. [the wire finally comes down from the wall]"
Brian," Oh, I see the wire."
Stewie," You see the wire what, Brian? Over."
Brian, [grabs the wire and pulls hard] OVER!
Stewie," So, listen. Uh, we're gonna wanna be leaving now."
Brian, Why?
Stewie, Because I just emptied a full tank of gasoline and lit a match; We've got about five seconds. [they run out of the house before it explodes]
Brian, Didn't we have an electrician in there today?
Stewie," Uh, he left. Uh, pretty sure he left."
Brian, Isn't that his truck? [camera pans to the electrician's truck]
Stewie," Well, by God, Brian, we're murderers. I guess this means you'll be going to Doggy Hell."
Lois," Meg, are you sure you wanna go through with this? [marrying Michael] You know, there are other options."
Meg," Mom, I'm not getting an abortion!"
Lois," Well, I'm not saying an abortion, per se. Maybe you just drink and smoke a lot."
Meg, What?!
Lois," Just don't start doing it, and then chicken out halfway through the pregnancy because then you'll wind up with Chris."
Neil Goldman, Hello.
Chris Griffin," Hi. Name, please."
Neil Goldman, Neil Goldman.
Chris Griffin," [checks his list] Goldman, Goldman. Sorry, no Neil Goldman."
Neil Goldman," Oh, I beg your pardon. I meant to say Chris Griffin."
Chris Griffin," [checks his list] Griffin, Griffin. Oh, here it is. Says you're supposed to be an usher. [hands his list and pen to Neil] Well, you'll need this."
Neil Goldman," Name, please."
Chris Griffin, Chris Griffin.
Neil Goldman," [checks his list] Griffin, Griffin, hmm. I'm sorry, sir, Chris Griffin has already checked in."
Chris Griffin," Well, that's impossible!"
Brian," This is disgusting! It smells, it's falling apart, and you can hear the mice humping in the walls."
Mickey," Oh, that was so awesome!"
Lois," Wow, Peter, I got to say. You've really been true to your word about treating Meg better."
Peter," She's my only daughter, Lois. She needs to be protected, like a rare gemstone or the herniated scrotum of an older gentleman."
Peter," So, you are here to take out my daughter. What are your intentions?"
Michael," I just think Meg is really cool, and I want to get to know her better."
Peter," You know, Michael, my daughter's womb is not a wild fire for you to douse with your adolescent seed."
Michael, I understand.
Peter," Do you, Michael? Do you? We'll see. Let me ask you a question. You ever sit on your arm till it falls asleep and then play with yourself and pretend like somebody else is doing it?"
Michael, Honestly... yes.
Peter, Not anymore you don't 'cause you're going out with my daughter.
Meg, I'm pregnant!
Chris," Dad, I swear to God. I didn't know that when I set you up with her."
James Woods," Hello, officer. Would you be kind enough to remove this trespasser from my home?"
Peter, What are you talkin' about? This is my house!
James Woods," No, this house belongs to Peter Griffin. [pulls out Peter's wallet] And that's me."
Joe," [going through the contents] Hm, driver's license, social security card, passport, title to the house... [sighs] This puts me in a tough spot."
Lois," Joe, you can't possibly believe this! You know who Peter is!"
Joe," I know, Lois, but this man has all the paperwork."
Brian," Oh, come on! This is identity theft!"
Joe," I hate to have to do this, but I'm afraid legally I have no choice. [to Peter] I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir."
James Woods," Thanks, Joe. ""Clam"" later? We'll hoist a few?"
Joe," [to James Woods] Sure, Peter."
Lois, Joe!
James Woods," Hey, not so fast, pal, but...those are my clothes."
Peter," Oh, come on!"
Joe," You heard him, fella. Take 'em off. [Peter strips naked and hands his clothes to James Woods] Right down to the poop sack. [Peter and James stare at him] What? You don't all wear a poop sack..? DAMMIT, BONNIE! YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT THE POOP SACK!"
Brian," You won't get away with this, Woods."
James Woods," You know, you're not supposed to be in the house, Brian. You're more of an outdoor dog."
Brian, What the hell does that mean?
Brian," This is so humiliating. For God's sake, I went to Brown, and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind of... [suddenly a squirrel goes by, and Brian starts chasing it and barking. He goes in circles until he wraps the leash around the post and chokes on it] What the hell? This rope was a lot longer, and now it's somehow gotten shorter. What sort of black magic is this? [Stewie runs over to Brian]"
Stewie," Brian, guess what? I gave James Woods your novel to read, and you're not gonna believe this!"
Brian, [stands up in excitement] Really? Did he like it?
Stewie, He wants to option it and make a movie!
Brian, [wags his tail] Really?!
Stewie," No, he didn't really respond to it."
Brian," [disappointed] Oh. Listen, I need your help; run inside and get me a pair of scissors."
Stewie," Okay. I just hope I don't get distracted. I am a baby after all. [walks away] Ooh, a brightly colored dish towel! What did I come in here for?"
Brian," Listen, I need your help; run inside and get me a pair of scissors."
Stewie, No.
Brian, Why not?
Stewie, Because you made me watch 2 Girls 1 Cup.
Stewie," Okay, wait, so what is this now?"
Brian, Just watch.
Stewie, Why are we taping my reaction? [Brian fiddles camera]
Brian, Jus...just watch. [the video starts]
Stewie," Okay..they're lesbians, clearly. [unfazed] I dunno... I dunno what else... [twitch] Wait. Wait. Wai... Wh...wh...what? Wha..what?! No..! No...! Agh... Agghh! Aggghhh! Agghh, what is wrong with you?! Oh, my God! Agh! Aggh! Oh, I'm never gonna be able to eat ice cream agai...OH MY GOD! [covers mouth, begins to retch; muffled] Agh! Agh..! Oh my God! Agghh...! Oh, that is disgusting! Oh my God! Oh, could you imagine if two dudes did that? Oh my God, that would be even worse. I mean, like, would that..would that even exist? Li...uhh... Like, where'd you even find it? Let's type it in and see what comes up."
Stewie," So you can just rot out here, Brian."
Chris," Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late. I brought a friend home for dinner. [Peter walks in wearing a typical kid's clothes, including a white/green-striped shirt and a red cap] Mom, ""Dad"", this is Scooter."
Lois," [turns around see Peter, recognizing him immediately] Oh...hello, Scooter."
Meg," Hi, Scooter."
Peter," Hey, everybody! Sure is swell of you to have me over! What's for eats, Mrs. G?"
Lois," Uh, meatloaf, Pe...I mean, Scooter. I hope you like it."
Peter," Leapin' Lizards, meatloaf is my favorite!"
Meg," Scooter, how come we've never met you before?"
Peter," [breaking character] Shut up, Meg."
James Woods," [suspiciously] You know, Scooter, we don't allow hats at the dinner table."
Peter," Uh, my bad, Mr. G."
Chris," Dad, no! [Peter removes his hat]"
James Woods," A-ha! I should have known! [pulls out a shotgun] Get out of my house right now, you son of a bitch! [Peter runs out of the house as James fires several times. Peter then gets on a child's big wheel and pedals down the street until he crushes it and starts crying in pain like a child]"
Peter, Agggghhhh! Owwwww! Owwwwww! Owwwwwww!
Brian," Wait a minute, Peter... If he's Peter Griffin, then that means you can be James Woods."
Peter," That's a great Idea, Brian! If I was a famous movie star, I wouldn't even want my family!"
Brian," No, no, Peter, I'm saying you can do to him what he did to you; you can ruin him."
Peter," I'll do it. I'll be James Woods. [goes out on the fire escape] From this day forth, I am James Woods! And I'll stick to that story even if nobody believes it. [camera pans down to Vern, one of the Vaudeville duo, now as a ghost]"
Vern," I'll tell you what nobody believes in... ghosts. [starts singing and dancing to piano music] Where did Robinson Crusoe go with Friday on Saturday Night? Ha! ...Damn! Play me off, Johnny! [camera pans down to Johnny in Hell, who plays his piano part as always] [to the audience] You're probably wonderin' why he's in Hell. Johnny liked little boys."

 I can remember the last time I have ," never. That's the writer in you, Brian. Did you always know that's what you wanted to do? Well, actually, I really thought I was going to be an actor at one point. I even got a few high profile gigs. Really? Anything I've seen? Oh, you ever heard of a tiny, little independent movie called die hard? - Wow! You were in that? - Sure was. What do you say we go back to my place and I'll show it to you? Sounds good to me. We'll have to be a little quiet, everyone's asleep. Have a seat. Okay, watch this. This is my scene. Doesn't make sense, man. Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang. The way you drove that car, I figured you for the street, Al. In my youth. Here it comes. Watch, watch. We've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after their release, and even corresponded with them in prison. No, no, no, darling. Asian dawn. Dawn, d - a - w - n. - Sir? - I... Yeah? Sir, the FBI is here. Hold... The FBI is here now? Yes, sir. Right over there. Hold this. Want a breath mint? Breath mint. I ad-libbed that line. Well, I had no idea I was dating a famous actor. - Should we go upstairs? - Sounds good to me. That's right, Shia, give me all you got. Okay, the coast is clear. Oh. Good morning. Oh, uh, hey, Lois. Who's, uh, who's your friend? Uh, Rita, this is Lois. Lois, Rita. So great to meet you. Lovely to meet you. Perfect, everyone hits it off. Listen, why don't you wait in the car, - I'll be out in a minute. - Okay, sweetie. Well, you met her. What do you think? - What? - What do I think? She's a hundred! Oh, my god! Peter, did you see her? I'm looking at her now! I can see her from the window up here! Hey, anybody make a Jessica Tandy joke yet? - No! - Awesome! I'll be right down! Brian, who are you dating, Jessica Tandy? Son of a bitch. Damn it, Chris, I called that from upstairs! What are you guys talking about? She's a beautiful woman. Lois, you of all people should be pleased. I mean, all the crap I take for dating young bimbos. How old is she, Brian? Wha-what difference does it make? Age has nothing to do with anything. Okay, you know what? I'll bring her to dinner, and you can see for yourself what a bright, fun, and charming woman she is. Wonderful. I'll cook something that's not too binding. Well, Rita, I'm so glad you could join us for dinner. Thanks for having me, Lois. This food is delicious. Oh, thank you. I'm so glad you can taste it. You know what we haven't done for a while? Go around the table, and everybody says what year they were born. Uh, so, kids, how was your day? Well, the sandbox... It was great! Guess he's going first. We got a new pencil sharpener in math class! Well, that's nice. Say, Rita, who was president when you were born? - Great pot roast, Lois. - Thank you, Brian. Would you like me to cut yours up a little smaller? I'm fine. Boy, speaking of that, I don't know how many people have asked me today where I was when Martin Luther King was shot. I'm sure you've been asked. What do you tell them? Ugh, who can forget? I remember just crying like a baby. Crying like a baby, or crying like someone in college? Say, Brian, on her answering machine, how long after her message is the beep? This has just been a delight. Oh, you can't go yet. We haven't had dessert. Interesting. You know, the first time I had dessert was 36 years ago today. How about you, Rita, you remember your first dessert? Oh, lord, no. It was so many years ago. Like 40 years ago? - Peter. - What were stagecoaches like? 50 years ago? Would that be a good guess? - Oh, dear. - Peter! How old are you?! How old are you?! Fifty! Okay! I'm fifty! Happy now?! You people are awful! You know, this is what's wrong with society! Nobody bats an eye if a woman dates an older man, but god forbid it's the other way around! There is nothing wrong with me dating Rita! She's beautiful, she's a charming woman, and I love her! - Rita... - Oh, Brian, please leave me alone. They're right, I'm just an old fool thinking we could be together. Will you stop that? They're insane. They don't know what they're talking about. You're an amazing woman. Oh, you're just saying that. No, I'm not. The only thing that matters is how I feel about you. Rita... I love you. I love you, too, Brian. I think you're the most wonderful woman I've ever met. Will you marry me? What did you just say? Come on, you're only 50, you heard me. - Will you marry me? - Oh, Brian. Yes. Yes, Brian, I'll marry you! Hey, mom. Hey, Brian. We'll be upstairs. Yo, Rita, you want in on this? No, thanks. We just got engaged! I'm faithful to Brian now. Whatever. This ain't even my whole night. You're engaged?! Yes. Rita and I are getting married. My god, I can't even react big enough. Here's Mrs. Garrett. What?! Look, if my happiness means so little to you all that you have Charlotte Rae just standing by to crack a joke, then you really disappoint me. Look, Brian, I apologize for the other night. We-we were all very insensitive. And if this is what you want, we as a family, support your decision. I don't. I'd-I'd rather you marry a- a-a-a-a-a-a... A japanese or something. I'm with you, too, buddy. In 20 years, she'll be 70, and you'll have been dead for 15 years. God bless the both of yous. Hey, it's 4 : 30. Isn't there an early bird special you should be running off to? She's 50, Stewie. She's not an old woman. Hello? Hey, Rita. Uh, no, I'm not hungry yet. Well, if we get there by 5 : 30, I'm sure they'll honor it. Brian, is she calling dinner ""supper?"" So, what are you doing this afternoon? ""Oh, I'm just sorting out my pills for the week, sweetie. "" well, you do that, and I'll be over a little later. Huh? Did I get it? Was she sorting out her pills for the week? In that little plastic thing with the seven boxes? Hmm? Actually, she just got back from the gym, and she's jumping in the shower. - She got a chair in that shower? - Shut up! Have archaeologists ever discovered ancient egyptian pottery in her vagina? You know what? That one was too wordy. That one was too wordy. That-that was- that was flawed from the ground up. It wasn't funny, and we'll work on it and get back to you. - Hey, Rita? - Yeah? - Where do you keep your toothpaste? - What are you looking for, tooth polish? - Toothpaste, yeah. - Just use the baking soda. ""Baking soda""? Ah, what the hell, I can skip a night. Oh, I've never noticed this picture before. Is that you when you were a little girl? Oh, yeah. That's the summer my family went to DC. That, uh, flag's missing some stars there. Why don't you come to bed, Brian? What do you say we make a little whoopee? Yeah, sure. Why not? You're okay? I'm not hurting you, am i? No, I'm fine. What are you talking about? I just want to make sure you're comfortable. Oh, I love you, Brian! Sock it to me! - What?! - Ouch! - What's wrong?! - Oh, nothing. When I'm on my back, sometimes my breast can slide in my armpit. Just got pinched, that's all. Okay. - Was that your boob? - God, no! I think I broke my hip! - Oh, my god! Wh-wh-wh-what should I do? - Call the number on my bracelet! It says, ""Murray Hill, four, one, eight, five. "" that's not enough numbers! That's the number, Brian! Just dial zero and read it to Sarah. For god's sake, Rita! She's fine. She's out of surgery and she's resting. Well, how did she break it? Did she fall? Well, uh... She- Yes, she fell. Boy, you know, Brian, a woman her age comes in here, they don't always leave. Peter, she's going to be okay. Listen, Brian, you say the word and I'll go in there with a pillow and you won't have any more problems. How many times do I have to tell you, I'm sticking by this woman? - I love her. - Careful, Brian. Sometimes the things you love can disappoint you. Like that playboy issue. Ah, here we go. Playboy's ""women of the Olympics. "" Wow, those are some broad shoulders. Okay, I guess small boobs are good for swimming. That, that, those are balls. Brian?! Brian?! Oh. Is the soup ready? - Yeah, got it right here. - Oh, good. I need to take my pills. It's been three hours. You know, they warned me these blue ones were going to make me constipated. - Right they were. - Okay. I am plugged up. No, I-I got it. Do it, Brian. Do it. It's me as a pillow. You know what, Brian? Oh, I could really use some milk of magnesia. Okay, well, I'll go pick some up. Thanks, Brian. I love you. Oh, and-and if you're going out, get some milk of magnesia. Yeah, you just said that. I am plugged up. Wow, you are really pretty. Thanks. You know, uh, I wrote a book. What's that? It's like a long magazine. Huh? It's like the Internet made out of a tree. Oh. Weird. You want to have sex in the bathroom? Oh, gosh, what a treat. Yes. Yes, I-I would- I would like that. Boy, that took you a long time. Did you have to wait for the streetcar? Look, Rita, I have a confession to make. I met a girl, I had a couple drinks, - and I slept with her. - You what? I know, I feel awful. It was a terrible thing to do. I'm so sorry. It'll never happen again. But there's an upside. You see, these past few weeks I've been doubting whether we're compatible, you know, because of the age difference. But I realized that that doesn't matter. That what-what I get from you is what I always wanted : a smart, sexy, real person who I can talk with and share every piece of me with. I had a moment of weakness today, but in a way, it's all right because it's taken me to a place where I now realize that you're not too old for me. Isn't that great? You're not too old for me! You know what, Brian? You're not old enough for me. - What? - You cheated on me. That's what happened today. You can rationalize it any way you want, but to me, all that shows is that you're an immature guy who doesn't realize what a catch I am. I'm sorry, Brian, but you screwed up. Now, please go. - But, Rita... - Go! You can leave my apartment key on the davenport. Here? No, the davenport- The chesterfield. On this? No, does that look like a divan to you? Here? Ugh. Leave them on the chifforobe. You know what? Just take your fucking keys. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about."

Another news, a local man has won the lottery.
 remember, science has proven that within hours of conception a human fetus has started a college fund and has already made your first Mother's Day card out of macaroni and glitter.
Announcer, We now return to the All in the Family and Modern Family crossover episode.
Claire," Hello, Mr. Bunker. We brought some hummus."
Archie," Oh, yeah, I knew them two was hummus the minute they walked in the door."
Chris, Ruff! Ruff!
Stewie," Okay, that's enough."
Peter," Oh, my God!"
Lois," What is it, Peter?"
Peter, Look at this. Dennis the Menace is just shoveling snow. He's being helpful. We might as well just call it Dennis now. He's not a menace.
Lois, Not every strip is gonna be hilarious.
Peter, You know something? I could do better than these idiots. I should just go down to the paper and sell them my own.
Brian," Well, Peter, you might be underestimating the difficulty of writing a comic strip. As someone who occasionally dates the creative muse, I can vouch for the unforgiving face of a blank sheet of paper. In fact, I think it was William Faulkner who said..."
Peter, I'm back. I'm published. Check it out.
Peter," I call my comic ""For Pete's Sake"", because it points out things that make you shake your head and say, ""For Pete's sake."" This one's for tomorrow."
Brian," These are good, Peter. I like how you retell tired old gags with a detached, ironic approach."
Peter," Yeah, plus, it's all brand-new jokes that I'm really, really serious about."
Lois," Well, good for you, Peter, but how did you get published so quickly?"
Peter," Ah, the editor of the paper owed me a favor. I got him a picture of Spider-Man."
 Jonah Jameson, Why can't anyone get me a picture of the Spider-Man?
Peter, Here you go.
Peter," Yeah, I got a whole subreddit of superhero thong shots."
Jerome," Here's your beer, Peter."
Peter," Thanks, Jerome. What do I owe you?"
Jerome," Nah, you already paid me in laughs. (He laughs at a comic script of another island comic. This time, the man says to the monkey ""I think we should see other people."")"
Peter, I do a lot of island ones.
Joe," Peter, you should do one where a baseball player can't steal second, 'cause he's on probation, for drug crimes. Political."
Peter," Yeah, you put an island in there, you're in business."
Glenn," Hey, how about one where you draw a sock, and it says ""Sock it to me,"" or maybe draw Lois taking a hot-tub dump, and she just says whatever?"
Lois," Peter, your comic in this morning's paper is really offensive."
Lois," That's not funny, Peter."
Peter," Ah, you're just not getting it, Lois. See, his wife washed dishes for him."
Lois," Oh, for Pete's sake."
Peter," Aha, there you go."
Brian," Peter, you should see this. Your dishwasher cartoon has really outraged the online community."
Peter," What? Gosh, it's not like the Internet to go crazy about something small and stupid."
Brian," Peter, you have to apologize."
Peter," What, because of a joke?"
Brian," Not just a joke, Peter. A joke that angered some bloggers."
Peter," (sighs) Well, I guess this ain't the first time I got in trouble for something I said about a woman."
Peter," Oh, good, we can steal."
Joyce," And welcome back to The Flow. We're talking to Peter Griffin, the artist behind For Pete's Sake, which has caused outrage with a misogynistic comic. Here's a video of some outrage."
Peter," Yeah, those boos don't hurt so much 'cause you spent two minutes of the last segment applauding a red velvet cake."
Joyce," And if that's not bad enough, this morning's cartoon is even worse. Let's put that up."
Joyce," Mr. Griffin, do you really think this is an appropriate cartoon to run on Gloria Steinem's half-birthday?"
Peter, You sound angry. Did one of your friends get engaged?
Joyce," You have no idea how offensive you are to women, do you?"
Peter," What? I love women. I bet I can name more porn stars than you. But don't tell my wife how many porn stars I know. I'll get in a lot of trouble. I know all of them, though. There are people who just started an hour ago, and I know them."
Peter," Man, they seem really upset. I was just trying to make people laugh."
Chris," Ruff, ruff, ruff!"
Peter," No, no, they're angry, Chris, but they ain't gonna get violent. (A thrown brick shatters through the window.) Oh, cool, that brick I ordered. (Another one comes.) Wait a minute, I didn't order this brick. You may be right, Chris."
Lois," Peter, this is getting out of hand. I don't feel safe in my own home. Maybe we should get out of Quahog for a while."
Brian," You know, she's right. We should get out of town till this all blows over."
Peter," Okay, we'll go, but just give me a minute, I just wanna turn in my last ""For Pete's Sake""."
Peter," I'm like Michael Jordan, going out on top amid a flurry of gambling rumors."
Lois," Peter, where are we?"
Peter," I don't know, I just woke up, too. I tied the steering wheel to my belt. I figure we've been on the road about 20% of the time."
Chris," Ruff, ruff!"
Peter," Um, I don't know. How long do women hold grudges? Not very long, I'm guessing."
Lois," Peter, we've been driving all night. Pull over to that gas station. We can use the bathroom and stretch our legs."
Peter," You got it, babe."
Lois," Did you call me ""babe""?"
Peter, I did.
Lois," Oh, Peter. (She kisses him.)"
Meg, Ew! Mom?
Peter," You'll never have this, Meg."
Peter," Alright, back in the car, kids. For this length of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash."
Lois," Oh, my God! Our car!"
Meg, Someone's stealing it.
Peter," Ah, crap. Although, I gotta say, you never get to see somebody else driving your car. It's kind of cool. Kind of weird."
Lois," We're stuck here, Peter! And we don't even know where we are!"
Brian," Well, there's a sign."
Brian," Huh, guess we're in a town called Springfield."
Stewie," Springfield, eh? What state?"
Brian, I can't imagine we're allowed to say.
Lois," Oh, this Springfield place seems nice. We should visit here again."
Brian," I don't know, Lois. This seems like a one-shot deal."
Peter," Guys, we ain't here for fun, all right? We're here to find the police, report our stolen car... Oh, and don't drink the water. Everybody around here looks like they have hepatitis."
Chris," Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!"
Peter," Lois, whip out your boob, give the boy his lunch."
Chris," Ruff! Ruff, ruff!"
Brian," Yeah, Lois, listen to the man."
Lois, How about we just go into that store there?
Peter," Uh, uh, excuse me?"
Apu, Hello. Welcome to the Kwik-E-Mart.
Apu," Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me unplug that. Oh, such a nuisance! (He unplugs it.)"
Peter," Hello, funny-sounding Cleveland. What's the specialty to the house?"
APU," For you, I'd recommend the donut."
Chris, Ruff!
Meg, Yum!
Stewie, Have you guys seriously never heard of donuts?
Apu," These are made fresh every day. And then, several days later, we receive them and make them available for purchase."
Peter," Hey, are these... Are these free? 'Cause I forgot to mention, all our money is in our stolen car."
Apu," Thank you, come again."
Lois," Sir, we can pay you back for the donuts when we find our car."
Apu," You think that I am moved by your sob story? I come from a country where the words for ""sewage"" and ""beverage"" are the same."
Homer, I'll pay for their donuts.
Lois," Thank you so much, sir."
Man, For what? I didn't say anything.
Lois, Oh.
Homer, It was me.
Stewie, How come this convenience store has so many shadowy parts?
Homer," Apu, a dozen donuts for our albino visitors."
Peter," Wow, for real?"
Homer," No man should be so poor he cannot pay for a donut. I was once you. I couldn't afford donuts. Tell them what I did, Apu."
Apu, He stole the donuts.
Homer," I stole the donuts. So, here you go. Twelve. Ten, eight donuts."
Lois," That's very nice of you, Mister..."
Homer, Simpson. Homer Simpson.
Peter," We're the Griffins. Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then, uh, you know, the others. Brian, I guess."
Homer," Well, enjoy your... six donuts."
Peter," Mmm, yummy. Donut."
Homer," That's pretty good, but try it like this. (He takes a bite out of his own.) Mmm, donut."
Peter, Mmm. Donut.
Homer, I think you and I are gonna get along just okay.
WIGGUM," Yeah, alright, we'll be there, but if you wanna save us a little time, you can start tracing his body with chalk."
HOMER, This is the police station. (He whispers.) Be careful. I think some of them might be cops.
PETER," Oh, hey, there. Cool hat, weird nose. Hey, listen, my car got stolen, I was hoping you could help."
WIGGUM," Well, we got a procedure for handling alleged crimes around here. Let's see, uh, did you contribute to the policeman's ball?"
PETER, No?
WIGGUM," Well, that's too bad, 'cause he really needs one. He had an accident last week."
LOU," Yeah, I tried to jump over a parking meter."
WIGGUM," Alright, well, with no contribution, your report goes right into the circular file. (He puts the file in a circular file drawer.) I've gotta be honest, I don't usually check this file, so it might be a while until we find that car of yours."
LOU," Uh, Chief, that excuse to leave you asked for is here."
WIGGUM," Oh, sorry, I gotta take this. It never ends. (Both of the cops leave.)"
LOIS," Oh, thank you so much for putting us up until we find our car."
MARGE, And thank you for not being a band of hippie murderers.
HOMER," And now this again. You bring home two bands of hippie murderers, and suddenly, that's all you're about."
MARGE," Well, what do you say we have some lunch?"
LISA, Where's Bart?
MARGE," Well, he's at camp all week. I'm sorry you won't get to meet him. (The families say nothing.)"
BART, Got kicked out of camp. I superglued my counselor's butt cheeks together.
MARGE, That's terrible. But how did you even get access to his butt cheeks?
BART, I'm not the only one who got kicked out of camp.
MARGE," This is Bart. Honey, your hands are filthy. Go wash up for lunch."
BART, Eat my shorts!
STEWIE," ""Eat my shorts."" I love that! Is that a popular expression, like ""what the deuce""?"
BRIAN, Probably more popular. Probably... Probably way more popular.
BART," Well, here's my room. Hey, you wanna see my weapons closet?"
STEWIE," You have a weapons closet, too?"
TODD, Ouch! Jesus heard my mean thought!
STEWIE," A slingshot! It's so simple and pure. He doesn't need lasers or time machines, just gumballs and marbles and balls of string. He's like something out of Mark Twain!"
BRIAN, Whose real name was Samuel Clemens.
STEWIE, How... How does that further this conversation?
BART," Hey, you wanna make a prank phone call?"
STEWIE," Ooh, prank phone call!"
MOE," Moe's Tavern, Moe speaking."
BART," Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a friend, last name Keybum, first name Lee."
MOE," Uh, hang on, I'll check. Uh, hey, guys, do I got a Lee Keybum? Come on, look at the stools is there a Lee Keybum? Oh, somebody check the rear, I know I got a Lee Keybum."
BARNEY, Then you probably shouldn't be handling food.
STEWIE," Oh, my God, that's amazing! That's the coolest thing ever! Hey, I want a try."
BART, Okay.
MOE, Moe's Tavern.
STEWIE," Hello, Moe? Your sister's being raped! (He hangs up.) Is that... Is that one?"
LISA," So, this is my room. Please excuse the mess. (She puts her stapler in place.) There, that's better."
MEG," Look at all these trophies! There must be, like, 20 of them!"
LISA, 23. But I'm sure you have a lot of trophies of your own.
MEG, No. I'm not good at anything.
LISA," Oh, Meg, I'm sure you're good at something. We just have to find out what it is. After all, Nelson Mandela said it's our obligation to shine."
MEG, You mean like my oily face and back?
LISA," No, maybe don't sit on my bedspread, please, but I mean the light within you that makes you an individual. Meg, you need to know that you matter."
MEG, Really? No one's ever told me I mattered before.
LISA, That's why you have to say it. So say it.
MEG, I matter.
LISA, Louder!
MEG, I matter!
PETER," Shut up, Meg, you don't matter!"
BRIAN," Hey, couldn't help but notice there's no seat for me?"
MARGE," Oh, I was under the impression that you were a dog."
STEWIE," You're right to have that reaction, Marge."
BRIAN," Well, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that..."
MARGE, Have you ever drunk out of a toilet?
BRIAN, I don't see what that has to do with the discussion.
MARGE, Dogs eat in the kitchen.
STEWIE," Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen!"
BRIAN," You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right? Are you cool with that? Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, you do. So, is that... is that, like, your thing? You eat loud?"
S LITTLE HELPER," Arf, arf, arf!"
BRIAN," Uh, I'm sorry, I don't know what... That's a gutter language."
LOIS," Are you making friends in there, Brian?"
BRIAN," Yep, he's a lot of laughs."
PETER," Wow, you work at a nuclear power plant? What's that?"
HOMER, I don't know.
PETER, Pretty impressive. I just work at a brewery.
HOMER," Oh, my God, you get to work with beer? Wow! What's beer really like?"
PETER," Heh, he's got a big head. (He giggles) Hey, you know... Aw, damn it, I don't have a comic strip anymore."
MARGE," So, still no word from the police on your stolen car?"
HOMER, Pfft! The cops here are a joke. I bet you and me can find your car on our own.
PETER, You think so?
HOMER, Yeah. 'Cause Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are a great team!
PETER, A greater team than...
HOMER, Than...
PETER," Yeah, keep going. Than something else?"
HOMER, Something else? I don't know what this is.
PETER," Are you... Okay, I'll do it. Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are an even greater team than the Air Force!"
PETER," Hold steady, I got them in my sights!"
HOMER, Whoo-hoo!
PETER, Yeah-heh-hah!
BOB," Yeah, we did it!"
HOMER, What's he doing here?
PETER," Uh, we gotta carry him, because he can't fly on his own. We let that other guy try, and look what happened."
CLEVELAND," No, no, no, no, no, no! (He crashes.)"
CHRIS," Wow, they've made a lot of changes to Quahog."
BRIAN," Chris, we're in a different town."
CHRIS, Oh. Is that why there was blood in my stool?
BRIAN," No, that sounds like a separate issue. God, I can't believe I got stuck taking their stupid dog for a walk."
CHRIS," Stupid? Well, I don't know, I think he's kind of fun."
BRIAN," What, are you kidding? He doesn't do anything. You know, it's not his fault, though. He doesn't know any better. He's been on a leash his whole life. Hey, you know what? Come here, Santa's Stupid Name. You're a grown dog, start acting like one."
BRIAN," Come here, boy."
BRIAN," Hey, stop that dog!"
PATTY," Sorry, we're on a smoke break."
PATTY, Nothing beats smoking and standing.
SELMA, Although smoking and sitting does have its moments.
PATTY, You always have to argue with me.
 NICK," Oh, thank goodness! I was starting to think you wouldn't show, Dr. Dog."
 NICK," Boy, you really like to bleed, huh, guy?"
SQUEAKY VOICED TEEN," Hey, there's a dog in the dining area!"
KRUSTY, How'd that happen? Get back in there!
BRIAN, Which one is Santa's Little Helper?
CHRIS," I don't know, you're the one who sniffed his butt!"
BRIAN," Yeah, for, like, a second!"
BRIAN," Damn it, he's gone. We're screwed."
SQUEAKY VOICED TEEN, Welcome to Krusty Burger. May I take your order?
CHRIS, Your voice sounds stupid!
STEWIE," Oh, my God, that was great! I mean, unless you think it sucked, in which case it sucked."
BART," It was all right, dude."
STEWIE," Yeah, dude. So, you know, um, I'm only wearing this diaper as a dare, you know, it's not, like, an everyday thing."
NELSON," Hey, loser, I copied off your spelling test and got a D! (He gut punches him and Bart falls to the ground.) Ha-ha! (He leaves.)"
STEWIE," I say, how long has that boy been treating you like that?"
BART," Uh, about 24 years."
NELSON, Just who I was looking for!
STEWIE, Cowabunga.
HOMER," Alright, Peter, if we're gonna find your car, we've gotta think like a car. So let's fill up at that gas station."
PETER, I feel sick.
HOMER," Keep drinking, I prepaid forty bucks!"
PETER," Homer, maybe we're doing this wrong."
PETER," Oh, crap."
CUSTOMER, Haben Sie Homer und Peter MIT Chevron pump?
PETER," Okay, I got a great idea how we're gonna find my stolen car. We'll throw a car wash, free for stolen cars!"
HOMER," And then when we find it, we'll actually charge the guy!"
PETER," Well, none of these is my car, but we promised these scumbags a show."
LOU," Hey, Chief, we could arrest every single car thief in Springfield."
WIGGUM," After the show, Lou. After the show."
MEG, (yells) I don't know! I feel like I'm good at nothing!
LISA," Hey, everyone gets down on themselves sometimes. Those are the days I'm glad I have my saxophone."
MEG, Saxophone?
LISA, Yeah. My dad gave it to me.
MEG, My dad once gave me a gun to hide.
LISA," That's terrible. Whenever I feel any pain or loneliness, I just play away the blues on my saxophone."
MEG, Huh. I usually just beat up a cat.
LISA, Good thing we don't have a cat. Why don't you give it a shot?
MEG, Was that good?
LISA," It was okay, but it would be a shame to waste such great butcher's arms on a musical instrument."
STEWIE," Wakey, wakey. Good morning. You and I have quite a day ahead of us."
STEWIE," Oh, that's a clown I painted, so you know I'm truly insane. (Nelson muffles) You know, Nelson, I don't doubt that you've had a twisted childhood. Most evil people have. Hitler, Manson, Jaden Smith. But you're different from them, aren't you? Because they're rail-thin, and you're fat. You're a little piggy, aren't you, Nelson? In fact, I bet you're hungry right now."
STEWIE, What's that?
NELSON, I could eat.
STEWIE, Good. Because you're going to eat... my... shorts!
MARGE," Homer, you're never going to believe what we did. We saw a movie in the afternoon!"
LOIS," Yeah, we saw Surf's Up 2. Marge covered her eyes every time the penguins surfed."
MARGE," It made me nervous. They could drown. Hey, where's Santa's Little Helper? Brian, you took him for a walk, right?"
BRIAN," Uh, yeah, yeah. More like he took me for a walk. God, what a... what a fun dog. He's in the kitchen right now, totally accounted for."
BRIAN," I'll, uh... I'll go check on him right now, and Chris will come with me. But nobody else!"
BRIAN," Ruff! Ruff, ruff! Ah, there he is! Aw, you like that behind the ear, don't you, boy? Ruff! Ruff, ruff!"
CHRIS," Uh... Ruff, ruff! I'm another dog in here!"
BRIAN, How does that help us?
CHRIS," We're creating a broad story. (In normal voice) Also, Matthew McConaughey is in here, too! ""Alright, alright, alright."""
BRIAN," No, no, he's not really in here! We thought it was him, but it was just the oven! (He whispers) Now you're just doing voices."
CHRIS, Jack Nicholson?
BRIAN," Okay, Santa's Little Helper got all tuckered out from his playdate, so he went out back to take a nap under that tree where nobody knows quite where it is."
PETER," Hey, what happened to Jack Nicholson and that other dog?"
BRIAN, Yep.
LOIS," Wait, aren't you supposed to be looking for our car?"
PETER," Didn't find the car, Lois, but I found a good time with a good pal. Right, Homer? Hey, Quagmire who, right?"
HOMER," Yeah, Quagmire who? That's an actual question; I don't know who Quagmire is."
LOIS," Peter, I'm glad you made a friend, but what about our car?"
HOMER," Yeah, I got an idea about that. What's the one surefire way to find a lost car?"
PETER, Giant magnet?
HOMER, Giant magnet.
PETER, Giant magnet?
PETER, Giant plug?
HOMER, Check.
PETER, Giant curbside outlet?
HOMER," Oh, things never work the way they do on the box."
PETER," Okay, let's get this garbage out of the street."
HANS," Oh, dear, I was using that car as pants."
MEG," Oh, my God, Dad, it's our car!"
CHRIS, That confused old guy must have been driving it by mistake.
PETER, How many confused old guys do you got in this town?
ABE," I'm old, so I'm the victim!"
PETER," Well, Homer, thanks for helping me get my car back. And to show my appreciation, I got a little something for you. (He pulls out a six pack of beer.) Here you go. Pawtucket Patriot Ale; The best Quahog has to offer. Always keep an emergency six-pack in my trunk."
MOE," Oh, that's cool, bringing outside beer into my bar."
HOMER, Down the hatch! (He drinks the beer.)
PETER," Yeah, it's pretty good, right?"
HOMER, No.
PETER, Huh?
HOMER, It's not good. This beer tastes exactly like Duff. It's just a lousy rip-off!
PETER," Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's not a rip-off of Duff. It may have been inspired by Duff, but I like to think it goes in a different direction."
HOMER," No, this is just the same as Duff, but, like, worse!"
PETER," Hey, come on, now, this is my favorite beer you're talking about! Hell, I work for the company. It's my livelihood."
MOE," Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood is based on fraud. Look at this! (He rips off the label, revealing that it's Duff.) Huh?"
HOMER, (gasps) It is Duff. Your beer is in big trouble! You can't just slap a new label on something and call it your own!
PETER," Well, maybe Duff should be in trouble for... You know, not being that great."
HOMER, Duff is an icon!
PETER," Yeah, but some folks prefer Pawtucket Pat. I mean, don't get me wrong, I used to love Duff when I was younger, but I haven't even had it in, like, 13 years."
LAWYER," Be that as it may, I represent the Duff Brewery, and you, sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement."
HOMER," Aha, intellectual theft! What do you have to say about that, Griffin?"
PETER, D'oh!
LOIS," The Pawtucket Patriot Brewery being sued? It's the largest employer in Quahog, Peter. A lot of people's jobs are riding on this."
PETER," Yeah, I got a job for you riding on something."
LOIS, Peter!
PETER," Sorry! Sorry, Lois, I'm tired, 'cause we usually only do these things for half an hour."
PETER, Simpson.
HOMER, Griffin.
PETER," Nice day, isn't it? Nice day for stabbing a friend in the back."
HOMER," Yeah, and a nice day for bringing thieves to justice."
SUN, We're getting a lot of compliments.
CLOUD," Yep, we're doing something right."
LAWYER," Your Honor, citizens of Springfield and visitors from Quahog, my client, the Duff Brewery, is the victim of flagrant intellectual theft."
LAWYER," But it's not just the main Duff recipe that's been plagiarized. Several other Duff variations, packages and design elements have been similarly infringed, resulting again and again in pale imitations, cheap copies, clumsy counterfeits and weak substitutions."
GLENN, You like sex?
LENNY, Eh.
GLENN, I don't think we're very similar.
CLEVELAND, You know why they got us sitting next to each other.
CARL," Uh, 'cause we're the two funniest guys in our towns?"
CLEVELAND, Damn right. (They fist bump)
KRUSTY, I'm a Jewish clown.
MORT," Me, too."
WEST, Are you a mayor?
QUIMBY," Yes, I am."
WEST," Are you a ""cool"" mayor?"
QUIMBY," I, uh... I like to think so."
QUAHOG WOODS, You live in Springfield?
SPRINGFIELD WOODS," Yeah, I worked at the Kwik-E-Mart, researching a role."
QUAHOG WOODS, These guys are gonna lose.
FRED," I've heard all I need to hear to make a decision. If you ask me, neither of these beers is wholly original. They're both pale imitations of my favorite beer, Bud Rock."
PETER," Oh, ho, ho!"
HOMER, Ooh!
FRED, But rendering a verdict is something I'm paid to yabba-dabba-do!
BOTH, Eh.
FRED, And I find in favor of Duff.
LOIS," Oh, no!"
MEG," Oh, no!"
PETER," Oh, no! (Nothing happens. He gets a call.) Hello?"
AID MAN," Uh, hey, I'm... I'm in the wrong Springfield."
MARGE, So what's going to happen now?
LOIS," Well, the Pawtucket Brewery will be shut down, so I guess we've gotta go back to Quahog and find Peter a new job."
MARGE," Hmm, that's too bad."
LOIS," Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice to meet you and your family, even though you kind of screwed us over."
MARGE," Good to have you. And, hey, next time you stay with a family, maybe you could wear a bra some of the time."
BRIAN," Hey, uh, Marge, uh, listen, there's something difficult that I've been trying to figure out how to tell you, and, um... It's about, uh, Santa's Little Helper."
MARGE, What about him?
BRIAN," He's, um... (Santa's Little Helper appears next to him.) right there."
MARGE, You were trying to figure out a way to tell me that?
BRIAN, I overthink things sometimes.
CHRIS," Oh, and, look, he's with Ed McMahon! ""Hey-o! Here's Johnny!"""
BRIAN," Chris, we're done."
CHRIS," You may be, but ""I'm just getting warmed up!"" That's Al Pacino."
MEG," Thanks for being so cool, Lisa. I cut your name in my arm so I'll always remember you."
LISA," Meg, I want you to have this."
MEG, Your saxophone?
LISA," Yes, Meg. When you played the saxophone, I could feel your soul coming out. So, I want you to take this and shine."
MEG," Lisa, no one has ever done anything this nice for me. You're amazing, and I will never be like you. I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I'm not talented, I have the same shoe size as Charles Barkley, my prom date was a scarecrow I stole, and he left with someone else, the inside of my hat smells so bad, I'm not allowed in most restaurants..."
LISA," Hey, hey! (sweetly) Shut up, Meg."
PETER," No luggage, car's full, let's go."
BART," Well, nice knowing you, Stewie."
STEWIE," Same here, Bart. Hey, I hope you don't mind, I've got you a little present."
BART," Whoa, is that Nelson? Stewie, what the deuce?"
STEWIE," Yes, I... Oh! Oh, that's nice. You've got that from me. 'Cause, you know, I was starting to worry this was a one-way thing."
BART, You kidnapped him?
STEWIE," I kidnapped all your enemies. Nelson, Jimbo, Principal Skinner, Dolph, Kearney, Sideshow Bob, Apu. I know Apu's not your enemy, but I just wanted to say, ""I took a poo."" (He chortles.)"
BART," That is funny! But the rest of this is messed up, man."
STEWIE," I know, Isn't it awesome? So, how do you want to keep in touch? Facebook? Twitter? Late-night phone calls, lying on our tummies with our feet up in the air?"
BART," Stewie, I don't think we can be friends. You freak me out."
STEWIE," Bart, if we don't keep in touch, I'll kill myself."
BART," That's what I'm talking about. Later, dude!"
STEWIE, Later... dude.
HOMER, Aw.
HOMER," Hey, Griffin, sorry about your job. I was just sticking up for Duff. I love Duff, and Duff loves me. Duff can keep a secret, Duff never says no, Duff is more experimental than any partner I've ever had. Anyway, point is, I'm sorry."
PETER," You know, when I first met you, I thought, ""Hey, I love this guy!"" ""This is the funniest guy I've ever met!"" ""I'm gonna quote this guy to all my friends! I love his town, I love his family!"" But now, I think I speak for all of us when I say, I am over the Simpsons!"
PETER, I'm saying the Simpsons suck!
HOMER," Why, you...!"
HOMER, Huh?
PETER, Ow! What the hell? That really hurts!
HOMER," No, it doesn't! I do it to my son all the time."
PETER, You strangle your son? That's insane! No wonder he's fat and stupid and masturbates all the time.
HOMER, That's your son!
HOMER, Phew!
HOMER," Hey, knock it off! There's a kid back there!"
RALPH," Haha, I'm in danger."
PETER," Hey, that's no fair, I don't got none of them!"
HOMER, Uh-oh.
Homer, Ooh.
PETER, Damn it!
KRUSTY," And remember, kids, TV violence is fine as long as you don't show a nipple."
KODOS, Perfect. The earthlings are destroying themselves.
ROGER," Yeah, it's really great, isn't it, guys? We went to summer camp together."
ROGER, Bye! Thanks for having me.
PETER," It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury...! (He looses his, too.) Oh, I talked too long."
PETER, We're gonna make it!
HOMER," Trust me, we're not."
HOMER, Whoa!
PETER, Aah!
PETER, Whoo-hoo!
HOMER, Roadhouse.
HOMER, Say hi to Maude Flanders.
PETER, No! You say hi to Muriel Goldman.
HOMER, Who?
HOMER, What are you still doing here?
PETER, I think you're gonna get a kick out of this. You're parked behind me at your place.
HOMER, That is funny.
PETER," Hey, listen, I... I'm sorry we fought. I just wanted to make you laugh and cry. You see, I'm a Family Guy."
HOMER, I understand. I'm a The Simpsons.
PETER," Look, even if we don't work as best pals, I respect you."
HOMER," You, too. Let's just agree to stay a half hour away from each other."
PETER, With a pile of garbage between us.
COMIC BOOK GUY, Worst... chicken fight ever.
LOIS, It sure is nice to be back in Quahog.
MEG," Oh, and thank God all the commotion about Dad's comic blew over."
PETER," Oh, my God, I had a comic? That's hilarious!"
LOIS," Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore, but you are a local hero for defending our beer, and apparently, that's more important than hating women. So here you go, a Pawtucket Patriot Ale."
PETER, What? I don't understand. Ain't the brewery out of business? We lost a court case.
LOIS," Yes, we lost, but how are they gonna enforce it? What, are they gonna come here? I think we know that's never gonna happen."
BRIAN," Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bart didn't want to be your friend."
STEWIE," What? No! What are you talking about? He was lame. If you ask me, he kind of sounded like a girl."
BRIAN, Really? Kind of seemed like you idolized him. And I can understand losing a friend and feeling rejected.
STEWIE," Course you can, you're a loser. But not me, I'm a lone wolf. Speaking of which, I'm gonna go howl at the moon. Don't need nobody."
GRACIE, Shh.
PETER, And now the show is over now.
Seamus, Let's go up there!
Chauffeur, I've seen some terrible things.
s all the stale mail what never got delivered for one reason or the other," incomplete addresses, house at the top of a hill, anyone who uses one of those French sevens with a slash in it."
s the nutty thing," believe it or not, I'm actually married to Peter Griffin right now."
Man, Peter!
 you need to know one thing, I'm the one throwing out all your beige bras.
Lois," Hey, Gretchen?"
